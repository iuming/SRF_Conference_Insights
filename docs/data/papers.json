        "INTRODUCTION": "Upon completion of the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams \n(FRIB) construction project in April 2022, the scientific \nuser program started in May 2022. During the first three \nyears of user operations, the FRIB complex has safely \naccelerated more than a dozen different primary beams \nranging from 16O to 238U to beam energies ~200 MeV/u \n(Fig. 1). The primary beam power has increased by a factor \nof 20, from the initial 1 kW to the present 20 kW, including \nthe uranium beam (Fig. 2). More than 410 kinds of rare \nisotopes have been delivered to the user experiments. \nDuring the past year, the accelerator complex operated \nmore than 6000 beam hours with ~95% availability serving \nboth scientific and industrial users.",
        "THE FRIB SCIENCE PROGRAM": "At FRIB, the short-lived nuclei produced via \nfragmentation or fission can be used directly as fast beams \nfor reactions; they can be stopped in a detection system that \nmeasures their decays, or they can be slowed down in a gas \nstopper and used in precision experiments or made into \nreaccelerated beams with energies ranging from hundreds \nof keV to well above the Coulomb barrier. Thanks to this \nunique scheme, FRIB provides isotopes of any element \nlighter than U for studies as fast, stopped, and reaccelerated \nbeams. These complementary experimental opportunities \nallow users to directly address three of the four science \nchallenges put forward in the 2023 Long Range Plan for \nNuclear Science [1]. They also open up new avenues for \nthe applications of rare isotopes for the benefit of the nation \nand society. The published experimental results from FRIB \nalready address a wide variety of topics, including new-\nisotope discovery [2], the determination of a variety of \nnuclear observab",

        "USER OPERATIONS": "During the first three years of user operations, a series of \nAccelerator Readiness Reviews (ARR) and Instrument \nReadiness Reviews (IRR) were conducted, allowing the \nsafe increase of beam power and the extension to newly \ncompleted user vaults, as shown in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: FRIB Major Milestones for User Operations [8] \nMilestone \nDate",
        "OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND \nCHALLENGES": "Uncontrolled Beam Loss near Charge Stripping  \nThe \nrevolutionary \nthin-film \nliquid \nlithium \ntechnology [10] (Fig. 5) and the multi-charge-state \nsimultaneous acceleration [11] allow charge stripping at a \nhigh efficiency of 83% for uranium beams. However, the \nvariation in film thickness over time causes uncontrolled \nbeam loss. Feedback controls operating on both 0.1-second \ntimescale by energy compensation and multi-second \ntimescale by shifting of the impact point were \nimplemented [12]. \nA \nMachine \nProtection \nSystems \nThreshold Configuration Tool (MPS TCT) was deployed \nto optimally set the fast MPS and automatically configure \nthe corresponding beam loss monitors (BLM), ensuring a \nfast signal response time of 150 Âµs for this beam power \nlevel. \n16th International Conference on Heavy Ion Accelerator Technology,Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA JACoW Publishing"

It is designed to \nprovide intense primary heavy ion beams for nuclear and \natomic physics, as well as other application fields. The ac-\ncelerator consists mainly of a superconducting electron-cy-\nclotron-resonance (SECR) ion source, a continuous wave \n(CW) superconducting ion linac (iLinac), a booster syn-\nchrotron (BRing) and a high precision spectrometer ring \n(SRing). A fragment separator (HFRS) is also applied as \nthe beam line to connect BRing and SRing. Six experi-\nmental terminals will be built in phase-I at HIAF. The lay-\nout of the HIAF accelerator was shown in Fig. 1, and the \nmain parameters are listed in Table 1. \nThe construction of the HIAF project was started offi-\ncially in December 23rd, 2018.

        "SPECTROMETER RING": "SRing is designed as a multi-function experimental stor-\nage ring, which can be operated in three modes. Firstly, it \nwill be used as an isochronous mass spectrometer (IMS \nmode) with two TOF detectors for short-lived neutron-rich \nnuclei. Secondly, it is used to collect and cool long-lived \nrare isotopes for nuclear experiments, or accumulate and \nextract highly-charged stable ions for high energy density \nphysics (normal mode). Thirdly, it can be used to store H-\nlike, He-like or other special charge state ions for internal \ntarget experiments (target mode). Ions can be decelerated \nto tens MeV in this mode. Details are available in Ref. [6]. \nA 450 keV magnetized DC electron cooler is used to \nboost the luminosity of internal target experiments, and \nproposed to accumulate isotopes combined with stochastic \ncooling and barrier bucket system [7]. In addition, an elec-\ntron target system is equipped in SRing for atomic physics, \nwhich is similar to the e-cooler and can provide electro",

        "INTRODUCTION": "SPES is the INFN project to develop an ISOL facility for \nreaccelerated exotic beams, mainly neutron rich [1]. The \nproject is based on a high-power cyclotron [2] able to ac-\ncelerate one or two proton beams with a final energy rang-\ning from 35 to 70 MeV and a 750 Î¼A maximum total cur-\nrent. In case of double extraction, the two proton beams \nhave the same energy, but can have different current values. \nFor example, it is possible to accelerate and extract a very \nlow intensity beam, tens of nanoamps, on one arm of the \ncyclotron and hundreds of microamps on the other arm. \n \n* enrico.fagotti@lnl.infn.it \nThe cyclotron can supply up to eight users with corre-\nsponding beamlines: five on one arm and three on the other \narm. Two beamlines are fully operational: one, the BL1 \n(Beam Line 1), to reach an ISOL target and the other, BL2 \n(Beam Line 2), to directly irradiate thin targets for nuclear \nand medical purposes. A third line is currently under instal-\nlation to irradiate thick targe",

The \nnew building was connected to an existing one where CB, \nits injection line, MRMS and transfer line to RFQ replaced \nthe old transfer line used to transport ALPI high energy \nbeams to an experimental area. RFQ itself and its transfer \nline to ALPI was installed in the ALPI building (Fig. 1). \nIn the last years, SPES project proceeded in parallel to \nall other LNL activities. At the end of 2023 there was a par-\nadigm shift: SPES project became first lab priority and it \nwas reorganized into five main phases to be achieved in \nsequence. Details of phases are the following: \nâ¢ Phase 1: Cyclotron recommissioning and BL2 test; \nâ¢ Phase 2: First RIB produced with low current primary \nbeam and transported just outside bunker (Phase 2A) \nand at the tape station location on the LERIB (Low \nEnergy RIB) experimental area (Phase 2B); \nâ¢ Phase 3: Installation finalization and beam comm",

        "DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF FRIB": "NORMAL CONDUCTING CAVITIESâ\nX. Raoâ , N. Bultman, S. Miller, P. Ostroumov, A. Plastun\nFacility for Rare Isotope Beams, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA\nAbstract\nAt FRIB, five unique designs of normal conducting cav-\nities were developed for a 40.25-MHz Multi-Harmonic\nbuncher (MHB), 80.5-MHz quarter-wave cavity MEBT\nbunchers, 161-MHz H-type cavity bunchers, 322-MHz H-\ntype bunchers, and a quarter-wave 161-MHz buncher for\na ReAccelerator (ReA). The paper will cover the main pa-\nrameters for each type of bunchers, their design/fabrication,\ncooling design, RF contact design/effectiveness, tuning pro-\ncess, brazing design and fabrication challenges, coupler de-\nsign, copper-to-stainless steel transitions, etc. The operation\nstatus of these bunchers will also be discussed.",
        "INTRODUCTION": "The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) started user\noperation in May 2022 after â¼10 years of project design and\nconstruction. FRIB since then has been used for scientific\nexperiments for â¼3 years successfully [1, 2], with recent\nachievement of 20 kW Uranium-238 beam on target, which\nis currently work record [3].\nEight normal conducting cavities with 5 unique designs\nare under operation along FRIB beamlines, primarily located\nwithin the Front End and Folding Segment 1 regions. Six\ncavities are under operations, and two more are planned\nsummer of 2026.\nFigure 1 shows the location of these normal conducting\ncopper cavities: each type and locations.\nNormal conducting cavities are made of high-purity cop-\nper using high-temperature furnace brazing.\nThey are\nequipped with motorized tuners for real-time frequency con-\ntrol. An efficient water cooling is provided for CW operation.\nWe have developed and applied a multi-step brazing tech-\nnique to achieve high dimensional accuracy, reliable ",
        "DESIGN PARAMETERS": "Table 1 shows major design parameters for four types of\nnormal conducting cavities, including operating frequency,\ngeometrical beta, aperture diameter, resonator diameter, cal-\nculated Q factor, vacuum level, and each cavityâs max RF\npower.\nFor MHB, model frequencies are 40.25, 80.5 and\n120.75 MHz, with total power for MHB is up to 100 Watts [4].",

        "MEBT": "buncher has 5 radially brazed circular cooling channels, with\neach ID on the cooling rings smaller from vertical up. And\nReA buncher has 4 side vertically brazed cooling plates\n(cooling of resonator main body also for IH bunchers and\n2H bunchers).",
        "FABRICATION": "Overall strategy for FRIB normal conducting cavity fabri-\ncation is to locate a qualified vendor with vertical integration\nof major fabrication processes and be responsible for final\nproduct, with capacity to do field tuning as well.\nRisk involving brazing is high and many factors can lead\nto not leak tight after brazing: low quality plating; dimension\nout of tolerance; improper brazing design; missing brazing\nalloy, inaccurate over temperature, etc. As for one overall\nbrazement, close to 100 brazing joints need to be leak tight\nat once.\nTo help vendor with better understanding dimensional\nerrorâs impact to the cavity performance, a table of tolerances\nbased on each valueâs sensitivity is provided to vendor. This\nalso help the cost to be reasonable.\n16th International Conference on Heavy Ion Accelerator Technology,Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA JACoW Publishing",
        "TUNING PROCESS": "A device for each cavity is designed to have extra material\nto cut during final tuning process, usually fixed tuners, also\na plug threaded at bottom of long center stem.\nDuring final tuning, FRIB representative is present at ven-\ndor site to witness leak checking (with cavity inside a plastic\nbag with no leak for at least 15 minutes), and frequency\ntuning (tuning range by motorized tuners, Q factor value\nmeasurement with at least 80% of calculated Q value as tar-\nget). Usually three steps of tuning are done to cut different\nlength of the tuning device. Normally the intended cut length\nand actual cut length is within 1 mm, with consideration of\nvacuum, gravity and ambient temperature.",
        "OPERATIONAL STATUS": "The installed normal conducting cavities support FRIB\nfacility beam operation during last few years. There are\ncouple of minor issues during installation, and improvements\nhave been implemented in next device design. These devices\nhave caused no downtime.",

The\nsketch on the right is to illustrate what is seen on the left\nphoto; a round jet of the liquid lithium is produced by the\nnozzle, which impinges on the edge of a deflector, which\ntransforms the jet into a thin film. The beam goes through\nthe film to be stripped. The beam spot can be seen on the\nleft photo. The beam power lost in the stripper is estimated\nto be about 60 W. The beam power at the stripper and at the\ntarget was 2.2 and 19.5 kW, respectively. To achieve this,\nlithium stripper film instability needed to be mitigated with\ntwo types of feedback control implemented [8,11,12]. This\ndouble feedback compensation has two different time scales:\n",
        "SUMMARY": "FRIB is currently operating at a beam power of 20 kW\nincluding the 238U beam. FRIBâs BIDs have been support-\ning high-availability facility operations. The challenges that\nthe FRIB BIDs face stem from the extremely high energy\ndeposition per unit length into BID materials, which creates\nvery high thermal density and radiation damage in the ma-\nterials. FRIB has been implementing the phased approach\nto develop and deploy BIDs to support both user operations\nand power ramp-up, addressing the challenges. This has\nbeen proven to work per availability data of each BID.",

The step B consists in send-\ning a direct beam up to the final focal point, to validate\nthe correction behavior and correct performances of each\nelement, with a simple optics. The phase will start by end\n2025. In 2026, the last phase (C), consisting in making a\nreal reaction in the target, and making identification of the\nreaction product, will start during 2026.\nBoth identification setups, were commissioned off-line,\nare ready to receive the beam.

It aims to provide the nuclear physics\ncommunity with opportunities to study the products of the\nfusion-evaporation reaction, producing proton-rich nuclei\nthrough to heavy and superheavy nuclei. The project began\nin 2010 and has now entered its final phase. This paper\nprovides an update on the main equipment developed specif-\nically for the spectrometer, details the challenges we have\nhad to overcome, and looks ahead to the next phases of\ncommissioning.",
        "THE SPECTROMETER DESIGN": "In order to take advantage of SPIRAL2âs high-intensity\nbeam and study the rare and very rare events produced in\nthe target station, the spectrometer has been designed with\n4 main features in mind (Fig. 1): it should accept a 10 kW\nbeam, have a very good rejection rate of the primary beam\n(selectivity > 1013 in the first stage), have a fairly good\ntransmission (> 50%), and also be capable of performing\nmass selection (> 450) in high-resolution mode.\nFigure 1: Super Separator Spectrometer overview.\nThe spectrometer is a symmetrical two-stage design [1].\nThe first stage, called the momentum achromat, comprises\nthe target station and the main beam dump to get rid of the\nincoming beam that has not interacted with the target. The\nsecond stage, called the mass spectrometer, comprises an\nelectrostatic dipole and a wide-angle magnetic dipole to\nachieve the appropriate resolution. In total, the spectrometer\ncomprises 8 focusing triplets, 7 of which are superconduct-\ning and one of which is an op",
        "DEVICES AND THEIR STATUS": "The rotating target station (Fig. 2) has been designed\nfor heavy beams at 10 pðA (thermal heat calculation) at\n5 MeV/u [2]. It has a large wheel of 670 mm diameter that\nsupports 18 targets of 21.5 cm2. It rotates at a speed up to\n3000 rpm. The beam spot is very focused in the horizon-\ntal planes with standard deviation of 0.5 mm and 2.5 mm\nrespectiveley. To ensure the integrity of the target, several\nsensors detect any damage in the target structure. These\ninclude an electron gun, an alpha source and a silicon de-\ntector, as well as two Rutherford backscattering detectors.\nThe electronic control is able to synchronize the accelerator\nbeam (using the slow chopper) with the rotation of the target.\nThis prevents damage to the frames. The target station was\ncommissioned off-line, then on-line using a cyclotron beam,\nand finally qualified with a real SPIRAL2 beam during stage\nA of the commissioning plan.\nAfter the target the beam is conducted through the dis-\npersive zone (Fig. 3), that com",

        "CONCLUSION": "Most of the main elements of the spectrometer are in-\nstalled and individually validated. The budget is well under\ncontrol (projected, 28 Mâ¬in 2010 including buildings, actual\n34 Mâ¬in 2025). The challenges we had to face on the cryo-\ngenics, the superconducting magnets, and to some extend,\nthe electrostatic dipole, gives us in in-depth knowledge of\nthese complex systems, and this will be a strength for their\noperation. We still have to validate the good alignment of\nthe equipment (cold mass of the superconducting magnets),\nand define a way to efficiently tune the high-resolution mode\nThe year 2026 will be a crucial year for the project, with\nthe aim to pass the phase B and C. This commissioning will\nprovide the real figures concerning the rejection rate, as well\nas the transmission toward the final focal plane. We expect\nto be able to perform real experiments in 2027.\n16th International Conference on Heavy Ion Accelerator Technology,Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA JACoW Pu",

        "COMPUTATION MODEL FOR SPACE CHARGE EFFECT FOR BUNCHED": "BEAM IN COLLIDER RINGSâ\nH. Alampreseâ , Y. Hao, Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA\nAbstract\nIn the last two decades, numerical and experimental\nstudies have extensively explored the impact of the space\ncharge on bunched beams in both linear accelerators\nand storage rings. However, fully accounting for space\ncharge effects over the entire accelerator is computationally\nintensive, especially in storage rings, where simulations\nmust track beam dynamics over many turns and extended\ntime periods.\nIn many cases, space charge forces\ncannot be neglected, motivating the development of an\nalternative computational model. Here, we explore space\ncharge-induced nonlinear dynamics using a model that\napproximates the Coulomb force by concentrating its effects\nat discrete locations along the accelerator. This approach\nenables efficient analyses of the full six-dimensional phase\nspace evolution under space charge effects. Future work will\napply this model to further investigate the interplay b",
        "INTRODUCTION": "Over the past decades, collective effects have been studied\nfor their role in causing instabilities in accelerators. Several\nsimulation codes have been developed, playing a crucial\nrole in machine design and optimization, as well as in the\nstudy of nonlinear beam dynamics, including instabilities\nand resonances. Currently, the most widely used model is\nParticle-in-Cell (PIC). However, this approach may be less\nefficient for circular accelerators due to the extensive demand\nof computation resources.\nMoreover, the difficulty in\nmaintaining symplecticity makes it challenging to interpret\nthe results of long-term tracking. A first possible attempt of\nimplementing a symplectic model applicable to accelerators,\nsuch as rings and colliders, has been presented in [1].\nHowever, its computational cost scales with the number\nof Poisson modes and macro particles (ðmodes Ã ðparticles),\nand can become significantly high for simulations of over\nseveral thousand turns.\nThis work adopts a simplified Ga",
        "DEVELOPMENT OF A TRANSFER MAP\nFOR SPACE CHARGE": "The space charge force plays a crucial role in collective\nbeam dynamics, as each particle in the bunch experiences\nthe electromagnetic field generated by all other particles in\nthe rest frame. This interaction directly affects the particleâs\nmomentum and leads to modifications of their trajectories,\nresulting in betatron tune and amplitude modulation.\nThe transverse electric field generated by the beam\ncan be modeled using the 2-D Poisson equation. For a\nGaussian beam, the field can be accurately expressed as\nthe Bassetti-Erskine equation, which is derived from the\npotential of a two-dimensional Gaussian charge distribution.\nThis formulation directly depends on the position of the\nparticle inducing the electric field [2].\nAssuming a 2D Gaussian beam distribution,\nthe\nlongitudinal profile is treated as infinitely uniform, implying\nthat the electric field is independent of the longitudinal\ncoordinate ð§.\nAs a result, the transverse momenta is\ninfluenced by the electric field as shown in E",

These couplings\nplay a significant role in determining long-term beam\nstability in high-intensity machines such as colliders and\nhadron rings, where they can drive particles into resonance\nconditions, potentially leading to emittance growth or beam\nlosses. Understanding and mitigating such effects is critical\nfor ensuring beam stability and maximizing luminosity. In\na more accurate model, the beam size is expected to evolve\nunder the influence of collective effects. As a consequence,\nthe associated numerical errors will need to be smoothed\nwith a different technique. Therefore, upcoming research\nwill address the application of numerical techniques to\nsuppress such noise.\n0.21\n0.215\n0.22\n0.225\n0.215\n0.22\n0.225\n0.23\n-8\n-7\n-6\n-5\n-4\n-3\n-2\nFigure 4: Tune footprint obtained from 2.5D approximation\nassuming constant beam size.

Wakai1\n1Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, East Lansing, MI, USA \n2Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, IL, USA \nAbstract \nThe Facility for Rare Isotope Beams heavy-ion SRF lin-\near accelerator is designed to accelerate all ions up to Ura-\nnium to a maximum beam power of 400 kW. Several beam \nintercepting devices are essential to the successful opera-\ntion and maintenance of the accelerator, including a low \npower charge selector (LPCS) made of copper CONTAIN-",
        "INTRODUCTION": "The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) linear ac-\ncelerator (linac) uses a charge stripper to increase the mean \ncharge state of an ion beam, therefore increasing the energy \ngain of the beam from post-stripper linac cavities. This also \ncreates multiple charge states of the beam. While the FRIB \nlinac can simultaneously accelerate multiple charge states \nwithin a ÎQ/Q of about Â± 3%, it cannot accelerate them all. \nThe low power charge selector [1] (LPCS), as shown in \nFig. 1, is a set of moving jaws that act as slits to intercept \nthe lowest intensity charge states that cannot be accelerated \nand ensure that high-intensity charge states are allowed to \npass through a gap between the jaws to be accelerated. This \nbeam interception causes radiation damage due to the dis-\nplacement of lattice atoms, ion implantation and other irra-\ndiation effects such as transmutation. While the effects of \nradiation damage are observable on the LPCS, there is little \ndata available to show how the ",
        "METHODOLOGY": "Particle Current Calculations \nTo calculate the total displacement damage caused by \n238U, we must first calculate the total number of particles \nthat were intercepted by the LPCS. This must be converted \nfrom electrical current given by FRIB beam current moni-\ntors (BCMs). The conversion is given by: \nð¼ð¼ðð= ð¼ð¼ðððððð\nððâðð\n(1)\nwhere Ip is the particle current (particles per second or pps), \nIeuA is the charge current in electrical micro amperes, Q is \nthe ionic charge state and e is the elementary charge. Since \nmultiple charge states are intercepted, and each charge \nstate only composes a fraction of the total intercepted \nbeam, Eq. (1) becomes: \nð¼ð¼ðððð=\nð¼ð¼ðððððððð\nððððâðð= ð¼ð¼ððððððâðððð\nððððâðð\n(2) \nwhere fi denotes the fraction of the contribution of a par-\nticular charge state Qi to the intercepted beam current. \nSumming over the contribution of all intercepted charge \nstates, we get: \n ___________________________________________  \n*This material is based upon work supported by the",

        "RESULTS": "Once Eq. (4) was applied to the 238U current data from \nthe years 2023-2024, the total number of particles inter-\ncepted is estimated to be 7.3*1016. The PHITS simulation \ngave the resulting displacement damage rate along the \nbeam axis, as summarized in the Fig. 3. \n \nFigure 3: Arc-dpa along the beam axis near the Bragg peak.",
        "DISCUSSION": "While this study is limited to one singular primary beam, \nsimilar studies can be conducted in the same manner for \nany primary beam used at FRIB. This will allow us to cre-\nate a comprehensive irradiation history for the LPCS. \nCompiling such a comprehensive irradiation history will \ninform decisions regarding the scope and breadth of cur-\nrent and future PIE endeavours. This methodology can also \nbe applied to other components in the FRIB BID infrastruc-\nture such as beam dumps. \nWhile beyond the scope of this paper, these results imply \nthat not only can we calculate the total displacement dam-\nage, but we can also use Eq. (2) to analyze the damage per \ncharge state as well. This would allow us to create a map \nof the damage across the LPCS by ion species, allowing us \nto determine the impact of individual ion species on radia-\ntion damage to the LPCS and other BIDs in the FRIB in-\nfrastructure, further allowing us to narrow the scope of PIE \nwork, focusing on specific areas of inte",
        "LPCS": "is rated.  \n \nFigure 5: Damage observed on the LPCS jaw surface. The \nregion circled in red is a zoomed in view of the region on \nwhich we intend to focus our PIE efforts. \nHigh resolution photos of areas of high interest will be \ntaken. A profilometer will then be used to scan the surface \nprofile to identify areas of interest for microscopy work, \nand these areas will be sectioned. Once areas of interest are \nsectioned, SEM/EDS work will be done to find areas of \nhigh implanted ion concentration that could lead to more \nfocused TEM work. Once optical and SEM microscopy \nwork is complete, we will utilize nano-indentation to track \nthe radiation hardening behavior of the material, which can \nhelp us with tracking ion diffusion into the material. Once \nsignificant areas of interest have been identified by optical \nmicroscopy and SEM, TEM imaging will be utilized to cre-\nate cross-sectional images of samples. Additionally, the \nmechanism behind the discoloration across the LPCS as \nseen ",
        "SUMMARY": "Analysis of beam current data and PHITS Monte Carlo \nsimulations allowed us to calculate the total peak displace-\nment damage done along the beam axis by a 238U beam \nover the lifetime of a recently removed LPCS. In addition, \nwe were able to visualize the charge state distribution \nacross the LPCS using PHITS and visualize the damage \nalong the beam axis. The methods explored in this paper \nwill allow us to perform a similar analysis for all FRIB pri-\nmary beams and can be extended to any BID in the FRIB \nlinac. Future work should explore the damage dependence \non individual charge states and create comprehensive maps \nof the damage done by all primary beams for comparison \nto the observable damage on the LPCS. PIE will be per-\nformed on the LPCS to determine the interplay between \nvarious radiation damage mechanisms and a plan to do so \nis in effect. These simulations are the first step in correlat-\ning these effects to the displacement damage.",

These ions collide with a \nrotating graphite target, while the residual beam is ab-\nsorbed by a water-cooled static beam dump positioned at a \n6-degree angle to the beam path. The current beam dump\nconsists of a machined C18150 copper alloy block, explo-\nsion-bonded to AL2219 alloy with precision-machined\ncooling grooves. Cooling water is supplied through 3D-\nprinted Aluminum 6061 inlet and outlet components, facil-\nitating heat dissipation from the beam stopper. This paper\nexamines the thermal-hydraulic performance of the Mini-\nChannel Beam Dump (MCBD) under both nominal and\noff-nominal conditions.

However,\nthese tuners cannot account for fast changes in cavity reso-\nnant frequency. To make up for this, feedback systems for\ncavity amplitude and phase are implemented into the low-\nlevel RF controllers. These control loops do not tune the\ncavity; they merely provide more power to keep constant\ncavity amplitude and phase.\nFIRST CRYOMODULE TEST\nThe first cryomodule test was with the QWR without\ncathode port, fundamental power coupler (FPC), and cathode\nstalk. During the test, 30 MV/m gradient was successfully\nreached but relatively strong microphonics were observed;\nsee Fig. 2.

        "INTRODUCTION": "The LCLS-II high energy (HE) upgrade for SLAC adds 23\nsuperconducting cryomodules which will increase the beam\nenergy from 4 GeV to 8 GeV [1]. In addition to these 23 cry-\nomodules, there is consideration of a Low Emittance Injector\n(LEI) that is parallel to the existing electron source [2]. The\naddition of this SRF electron source can improve the photon\nenergy from 12.8 keV to 20 keV, which would enable study-\ning dynamics on the atomic scale [3].

        "VIBRATION SURVEY": "A vibration survey was conducted during the cold test to\nhelp diagnose the source of the microphonics. There were 9\naccelerometers placed around the outside of the cryomodule.\nThe vibration survey revealed that frequencies in the cavity\nsignal matched frequencies found from the cryogenic piping\nas well as the FPC. It was concluded that in combination with\nthe information from manipulating the JT valve position, the\npossible sources of the microphonics were coming from\nthe 4K cryogenic circuit that supplies liquid helium to the\ncavity or the excitation of an FPC mechanical mode. Further\ninvestigation at room temperature was conducted for the FPC,\nand a cryomodule rework was done to address potential root\ncause in 4K circuit.",
        "FUNDAMENTAL POWER COUPLER\nVIBRATIONAL MODE INVESTIGATION": "One possible cause for the strong microphonics was the\nmechanical modes of the FPC or other ancillary systems.\nDuring the cryomodule rework period, access to the FPC and\ntuner was possible. 6 accelerometers were placed on the FPC\nstructure and 1 on the backside of the cavity near the cathode\nstalk. This was an effort to determine the mechanical modes\nof the structures as well as the impact these modes had to the\nphase modulation of the RF. In order to find the mechanical\nmodes of these structures, the piezo stack in the tuner was\nused to shake the cavity + FPC structure. The frequency\nrange of 50 Hz to 250 Hz was swept; see Fig. 4.\nFigure 4: Frequency spectrum of mechanical vibration due\nto excitation of FPC flange with the piezo stack.

Shin\nInstitute for Basic Science (IBS), Daejeon, South Korea\nAbstract\nRecently, the Institute for Rare Isotope Science (IRIS, pre-\nviously RISP) in the Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Dae-\njeon, South Korea, finished the first beam commissioning for\noperating of low-energy superconducting linear accelerator\n(SCL3). SCL3 is composed of two types of cavity, quarter\nwave resonator (QWR) which has 81.25 MHz RF frequency\nand half wave resonator (HWR) which has 162.5 MHz RF\nfrequency. During operation, RF control was very compli-\ncated due to many issues including mechanical vibrations\ncoming from vacuum pump, cryogenic valve, or undefined\nsource. In this paper, we will discuss the SCL3 mechanical\nvibration data measured by laser doppler vibrometer (LDV).\nIn addition, the mechanical vibration of SCL3 cryogenic\ncomponents such as transfer line and supports will be also\ndescribed.",
        "INTRODUCTION": "IRIS has constructed a low-energy superconducting linac\n(SCL3) since 2012. Through enormous efforts by many\nresearchers and engineers, SCL3 construction was finished\nby 2022, and the first beam commissioning was finished\nby August 2024. During operation, IRIS experienced many\nissues such as RF or cryogenic control problem, SSPA mal-\nfunction, and general utility error. Among them, we are\ntrying to figure out the effect of mechanical vibration to the",
        "VIBRATION MEASUREMENT": "First, we planned to measure the whole SCL3 linac region\nroughly and shortly, because we expected that we could find\na tendency of mechanical vibration after two to three mea-\nsurement. Figure 1 shows the measuring points of SCL3\nLinac (Red dots). Three QWR cryomodules (02, 09, 20),\ntwo HWRA cryomodules (04, 09), and five HWRB cry-\nomodules (02, 05, 09, 14, 19) were chosen for measuring\npoints. To see the effect of connecting the structure, we\nâWork supported by the Institute for Basic Science (IBS-I001-D1)\nâ  atikus43@ibs.re.kr\nmeasured both the cryomodule wall and support at each\npoint. We started the measurement of mechanical vibration\nin December 2023, however, the first measurement became\na rehearsal for next measurement, device troubleshooting\nand solving other technical issues. After troubleshooting,\nthe vibration measurement data was gathered by February,\nMarch and September 2024.

        "INTRODUCTION": "JuTrack is a differentiable accelerator modeling package\nwritten in Julia that leverages automatic differentiation for\nbeam dynamics calculations [1]. A comprehensive descrip-\ntion of JuTrackâs architecture and capabilities can be found in\na paper also submitted to this conference [2,3]. The Facility\nfor Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) presents unique challenges\nfor beam dynamics modeling due to its multi-charge state ac-\nceleration scheme and the presence of charge strippers. This\nwork extends JuTrack to address these specific requirements\nwhile maintaining its differentiable nature.\nThe FRIB accelerator employs charge strippers to increase\nthe charge state of heavy ions, enabling more efficient accel-\neration. After stripping, multiple charge states are simultane-\nously transported and accelerated through the downstream\nbeamline.

Each charge state has associated magnetic\nrigidity values (Bð) that determine the particle trajectories\nthrough magnetic elements.

Rodriguez\nFacility for Rare Isotope Beams, East Lansing, MI, USA\nAbstract\nCameras observing scintillating viewers provide a valu-\nable tool for tuning heavy ion beams. The close placement\nof these cameras near intense stray neutron and ion radia-\ntion, particularly at elements intercepting the primary beam,\npresents a unique reliability challenge. Commercial solu-\ntions are sparse, expensive, and sometimes tightly regulated.\nWe present common failure modes observed at FRIB and\npropose solutions to extend the lifespan of unspecialized in-\ndustrial cameras using consumer-grade hardware and open-\nsource software.",
        "INTRODUCTION": "Scintillating viewers are a straightforward way to qual-\nitatively observe the alignment and shape of an ion beam.",
        "PROBLEM ANALYSIS": "Reactions caused by beam interaction with solid materials\ninduce stray radiation on the order of 1 â 10 Gy yâ1 total ion-\nizing dose (TID) [4,5], neutrons and photons. High-energy\nphotons (X-rays and ð¾-rays) can cause electrical effects by\ndisrupting electron-hole pairs in silicon, and neutrons can\nphysically displace atoms in semiconductor crystal lattices.\nPreliminary work [4] estimates the total soft error rate in\nsilicon to be roughly 2Â·107 FITÂ·MBitÂ·cmâ2 Â·sâ1 at current\nbeam power. That is, for a hypothetical device with a density\nof 1 Mbit in 1 cm2 of area, a soft error latch-up would be ex-\npected every 50 hours of operation. Empirically, soft errors\nare seen once per 6 hours of operation at the liquid lithium\ncharge stripper (LLCS), with hard errors and replacement\nduring maintenance necessary after 500-1000 hours of op-\neration on average. Figure 1 depicts typical performance\nduring 20 kW operation.\nâWork supported by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science\nunder Cooper",

        "DISCUSSION": "Use-Cases\nIn the case of FRIBâs first three years of operation, hard\ncamera failures induced by radiation have not represented\na significant fraction of unscheduled downtime, and main-\ntenance intervals are frequent enough to allow for proac-\ntive replacement. However, before the introduction of the\nabove-described methods, sensor damage and soft latch-ups\nbecame a significant nuisance. In this operating niche, it is\nfeasible to use remarkably inexpensive methods to automate\nrecovery from the most frequent failures.\nDifficulties and Future Work\nSome strategies, particularly that of using unspecialized\ncamera hardware, must be carefully considered with respect\nto the environment in which they will operate. With any\ninstallation, it is important to design for the characteristics\nof stray radiation fields that will be encountered. From\nthis information, a very rough estimate of the mean time\nbetween failures can be calculated to determine feasibility.\nThis estimate can be refined on exist",
        "CONCLUSION": "Placing cameras near devices producing strong prompt\nradiation is a necessary, but challenging task. Ionizing ra-\ndiation is particularly damaging to dense semiconductor\ncomponents, including CMOS sensors and most common\nforms of volatile and non-volatile memory.\nFor constrained budgets, we present inexpensive methods\nof extending the longevity of these devices, and mitigating\nthe most common errors without manual intervention. The\nmost prefarable methods involve commercially available, rel-\natively inexpensive hardware, open-source software. If nec-\nessary, shielding and distance enclosures are fabricated from\ncommercially available parts and fabrication techniques ac-\ncessible to most heavy-ion accelerator laboratories.",

After the pri-\nmary beam interacts with a production target, the resulting\nfragments, formed through projectile fragmentation or fis-\nsion, are directed to the Advanced Rare Isotope Separator\n(ARIS) [2,3] for the crucial steps of separating, identifying,\nand purifying the fragments relevant to a particular experi-\nment.",

During these\nexploratory ion runs, we realized that a coherent plan for\nfuture operation with ions is needed. Hence, the Future Ions\nWorking Group (FIWG) was created at CERN in 2023. To\ndrive an informed decision, the FIWG needed to quantify\nthe performance reach for every requested ion, take into ac-\ncount experiment-specific requirements, propose a possible\nupgrade to meet them, and assess the impact of using more\nthan one ion species on the operation of the complex while\nexploiting synergies between the requests. The table listing\nexperime",
        "LHC": "Run 5. A follow-up test reaching further down the injec-\ntor chain, possibly up to the PS, could be foreseen early in\nRun 4. In addition, LHC experiments recognize potential in\nshort exploratory runs of different ions, such as the ongoing\noxygen run and the subsequent neon run [12, 13].\nIn addition, the High-Energy Accelerators for Radiation\nTesting and Shielding (HEARTS++) proposal [14] aims to\nbuild a facility in the PS East Area or LEIR South Hall, pro-\nviding radiation testing capabilities for materials and elec-\ntronics to both scientific and commercial users.

        "BEAM TEST RESULTS": "This section summarizes recent beam tests and operational\nruns (excluding lead ions) conducted with the accelerator\ncomplex. The corresponding injector performance for each\nion species is documented in Table 1.\nArgon\nIn 2015 40Ar11+ was produced at the source and fully\nstripped to 40Ar18+ at the transfer between PS and SPS.\nThe run was dedicated to NA61 physics.

While performance was\nlimited by high magnesium consumption (requiring frequent\noven refills that disrupt operation and prevent optimal source\nconditioning), potential upgrades have been developed and\nwill be implemented in the next test campaign [17â19].\nOxygen\nAt the moment of writing, the oxygen beam commission-\ning in the injectors for the LHC run is ongoing with the\nbeam having just reached the SPS. Therefore, the oxygen\nperformance shown in Table 1 is not final. In addition, an\nearlier oxygen test was performed in 2023 [19, 20], but its\nresults are not reported here because they are superseded by\nthe measurements obtained during the present preparations.\nNeon\nTwo neon tests were done in 2025 in preparation for a short",

        "ION COMPLEX UPGRADE STUDY": "While initially ion physics at CERN was only approved\nuntil the end of Run 4, it has now been tentatively extended to\nRun 5. This means that the ion complex will have to be main-\ntained for almost a decade longer, hence the consolidation of\nageing equipment needs to be addressed. The development\nof an extensive upgrade plan that takes advantage of syn-\nergies with consolidation and has a long exploitation time\nperspective became feasible.\nPresent limitations\nThe FIWG collected future ions requests and identified\nthe following limitations of the ion injector complex:\n(a) From the beginning of Run 4, the ion complex will\nbe fully committed to operation with no time left to\ndevelop and commission new ion beams (assuming\nthat the NA61++/SHINE will be approved for Run 4),\nincluding:\nâ¢ LHC Run 5 main ion candidates;\nâ¢ LHC Run 4 light ions for short runs;\nâ¢ Ion mixture needed by HEARTS (O, Ar, Kr, Xe,\nPb), switching between these ions and perfor-\nmance evaluation in this mode of operation.\n(b",
        "SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK": "The ion landscape has been evolving at CERN for several\nyears now. The experiments and facilities request beams\nof new ions that are lighter than lead. Many ion species\nhave been operated to date, including argon, xenon, kryp-\nton, oxygen, magnesium, and neon. However, future experi-\nmental requests are challenging for the ion injectors, which\nwere originally designed and later optimized to maximize\nlead performance, but were not built with the flexibility to\nperform well with different ion species in mind. Thus, ex-\ntensive preparations are needed well in advance before any\nnew beams can be reliably delivered. After initial feasibility\nstudies, various risk assessments, and implementation of ob-\nvious mitigations, actual beam tests are essential to facilitate\nfuture operation within accepted schedules and to identify\nbottlenecks and hard-to-predict operational issues.\nHowever, with the recent increase in the operating time of\nthe complex and handling of more than a single ion species\n",

Linâ , Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, USA\nAbstract\nAfter many decades of successful operation, human opera-\ntors have become very good at finding the optimal conditions\nthat maximize the luminosity in the Relativistic Heavy Ion\nCollider (RHIC). However, since the entire accelerator chain\nfor RHIC is a constantly varying complex system, main-\ntaining such optimal condition is a demanding task. There\nis also no metric that can measurably determine if those\noptimal conditions are truly optimal, given the degrees of\nfreedom are very high and there are multiple and compet-\ning objectives. In this work we will describe how we use\nmachine learning and improved physics models to build sys-\ntems for optimizing the beam brightness during injection\nat the BNL Booster and AGS synchrotrons and efforts to\nmaintain maximum luminosity in RHIC.",
        "INTRODUCTION": "Large particle accelerators like the Relativistic Heavy Ion\nCollider (RHIC) are large systems that require analysis and\noptimization of thousands of parameters to operate at peak\nperformance. With the more complex Electron-Ion Collider\n(EIC) planned for future construction, such analysis will\nquickly become impossible to be performed entirely by hu-\nman operators. Machine learning (ML) has shown great\npromise in addressing long-standing challenges in accelera-\ntor physics, such as automated tuning and anomaly detection.\nIn this work, we study two major ML techniques and their\napplications for finding and maintaining optimal beam qual-\nity in the RHIC complex: Bayesian optimization (BO) and\nreinforcement learning (RL).",
        "MACHINE LEARNING METHODS": "Bayesian Optimization\nBayesian optimization (BO) is a technique aiming to opti-\nmize an objective function ðwith as few samples as possible.\nIt is particularly useful when the explicit expression of ð\nis unknown and evaluation of ðis expensive. Due to its\nsample efficiency and ability to learn without a preexisting\nmodel, BO has been widely implemented to solve complex\nparticle accelerator control problems, as summarized in Al-\ngorithm 1 [1].

        "INTRODUCTION": "ALPI (Acceleratore Lineare Per Ioni) is the last stage\nof acceleration of the heavy ion facility of Legnaro Na-\ntional Laboratories. It is CW folded independent cavities\nlinac, equipped with 77 superconductive quarter waves (QW)\ncooled down at 4 K, divided in three groups (low-ð½0.055\nat 80 MHz, medium-ð½0.11, high-ð½0.13 at 160 MHz both).",
        "BEAM DYNAMICS AND DIAGNOSTICS\nWEAK POINTS": "Beam Dynamics\nFrom the beam dynamics point of view, the main weak\npoint is given by the ALPI lattice: as shown in Fig. 2, it is\ncomposed by 3 normal conductive quadrupoles (for trans-\nverse focusing) and by 8 QWs cavities. This very long period\nimpacts the longitudinal phase advance, transverse RF de-\nfocusing, and the QWs magnetic steering coming from the\nresidual magnetic field on axis. The three effects follow the\nEq. (1):\nð0,ðâE0 sin(âÎ¦ð )/ð½2\nð¾ðð¹âE0 sin(âÎ¦ð )/ð½3\nð¦â² âBð¥sin(âÎ¦ð )/ð½2\n(1)\nAll effects are directly proportional to E0 and to the\nsin(âÎ¦ð ). Therefore, once the accelerating fields improved\nof a factor of 4, we increased the effects described in Eq.\n(1) of the same amount. Moreover, as it is possible to see,\nthe effects are indirectly proportional to the ð½2, ð½3 of the\naccelerating particle. This means that the initial acceleration\nstage (the low-ð½section and initial phases of medium-ð½) are\nthe most subjected to losses, and it is mandatory to increase\nthe energy of the beam as so",

        "AI TECHNIQUES STUDIES\nIN SIMULATIONS": "In order to reduce the setup time of the machine (which\nranges from two to three days), we decided to test artificial\nintelligence techniques, starting from simulations. The idea\nwas to reduce what it is naturally a multiobjective function to\na single objective function, in order to help the algorithmâs\nconvergence on the online machine. We focused the initial\nstudies using the Particle Swarm Optimization technique [2].\nWe apply the technique in simulations, both onto the steering\nand onto the selection of synchronous phases, in both cases\naiming to the FCs current after the acceleration sections.

Qiangâ , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA\nAbstract\nHigh-power superconducting ion linear accelerators play\na vital role in both scientific research and industrial applica-\ntions. However, their RF usage efficiency remains relatively\nlow. In this paper, we review two innovative concepts: re-\ncirculating ion linear accelerators and energy recovery ion\nlinear accelerators. These approaches significantly improve",
        "INTRODUCTION": "Heavy-ion linacs utilize niobium cavities designed to op-\nerate at a low frequency, minimizing the BCS resistance to \nkeep dissipated RF power minimal. The BCS resistance is \nthe largest contributor to surface resistance, and is a strong \nfunction of both operating frequency and temperature. Fig-\nure 1 plots calculated BCS resistances against temperature \nfor niobium at two operating frequencies (72 MHz and \n218 MHz), as well as Nb3Sn at 218 MHz. When operating \nat 4.5 K there is almost an order of magnitude difference \nbetween 72 and 218 MHz, and another order of magnitude \nlower for Nb3Sn even at this higher frequency. For the \nsame geometry resonator, the physical size scales inversely \nwith the fundamental frequency, meaning the physical size \n(and therefore cost) of a linac goes down drastically. This \nbenefit, coupled with the reduced dynamic RF load (allow-\ning operation on cryocoolers), allows for a shift in how \ncavities and cryostats are designed. \nWith the substantially high",
        "RECIRCULATING ION\nLINEAR ACCELERATOR": "In superconducting ion linear accelerators, good acceler-\nation efficiency is important in order to reduce the number\nof RF cavities needed in the accelerator. The acceleration\nefficiency can be measured by the transit time factor. For a\ngiven RF cavity, the energy gain Îð¸ðof a charged particle\nthrough the cavity can be written as:\nÎð¸ð= ðððcos(ð)\n(1)\nwhere ðis the charge of the particle, ð=\nâ«ð¿\n0 |ð¸ð§(0, ð§)|ðð§is\nthe voltage across the cavity, ð¸ð§is the longitudinal acceler-\nating electric field on axis, ðis the transit time factor, ðis\nthe design phase with respect to the maximum energy gain.\nFrom the above equation, we can see that for a given design\nphase and voltage, in order to gain more energy, the transit\ntime factor should be as large as possible.

        "ENERGY RECOVERY\nION LINEAR ACCELERATOR": "The conventional racetrack electron energy recovery accel-\nerator architecture is not suitable for an ion energy recovery\nlinac, as the high-energy ion beam exiting the accelerator\ncannot be returned to the entrance for efficient decelera-\ntion. This is because RF cavities designed for low-energy\nion beams are not effective at accelerating or decelerating\nhigh-energy ion beams.\nFigure 10 presents a schematic diagram of the energy re-\ncovery ion linear accelerator proposed in reference [23]. The\naccelerator comprises a low-energy ion source and an RFQ\n(Radio Frequency Quadrupole) that accelerates the ion beam\nto approximately 2 MeV. Subsequently, the beam is further\naccelerated through a superconducting linear accelerator,\nwhich includes several types of superconducting RF cavities,\nreaching an energy of GeV before exiting the accelerator.\nAfter interacting with the target material, ions that have not\nundergone significant deflection or nuclear reactions are\nredirected back to the exit ",

        "USA": "2Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, USA \n3RadiaBeam, Santa Monica, USA\nAbstract \nNb3Sn has been identified as the most promising next-gen-\neration superconducting material for accelerator cavities. \nThis is due to the higher critical temperature (Tc = 18 K) \nof Nb3Sn compared to niobium (Tc = 9.2 K), which leads \nto greatly reduced RF losses in the cavity during 4.5 K op-\neration. This allows two important changes during cavity \nand cryomodule design. First, the higher Tc leads to negli-\ngible BCS losses when operated at 4.5 K, which allows for \na higher frequency to be used, translating to significantly \nsmaller cavities and cryomodules. Second, the reduced dis-\nsipated power lowers the required cryogenic cooling ca-\npacity, meaning that cavities can feasibly be operated on  \n5-10 W cryocoolers instead of a centralized helium refrig-\neration plant. These plants and distribution systems are \ncostly and complex, requiring skilled technicians for oper-\nation and maintenance.",
        "PROTOTYPE": "A first prototype quarter wave cavity was constructed \nwith high purity (RRR>250) niobium (and reactor grade \nfor all non-RF surfaces) to serve as a base for the thin \nNb3Sn coating. Figure 2 shows the completed cavity as \nwell as a section view. The frequency chosen was \n218 MHz, a harmonic of the ATLAS clock, and substan-\ntially higher than typical quarter wave cavities. Subassem-\nblies were hydroformed at a local shop, Stuecklen Inc. The \ncomplex center conductor tip and gussets were machined \nby our collaborators at RadiaBeam. All welds were per-\nformed by electron beam welding at Sciaky Inc. The fin-\nished cavity was electropolished (125 Î¼m) before cold test-\ning without low temperature baking. \nFollowing fabrication, the bare niobium cavity was cold \ntested to verify a good substrate for the thin film coating. \nThe intent was to identify any possible defects that could \ncause early quench in the coated cavity testing. \nThe cavity had a low Q of 8 Ã 108, but this was expected \nas ",
        "ELLIPTICAL CELL": "To compare the performance against other niobium-tin \ncoated cavities can be difficult, since the different shapes \nhave different geometry factors making certain metrics \nseem less impressive, such the normal Q vs Eacc curve. \nFigure 8 compares the Q curves of the 145 MHz cavity \nwith a well performing 650 MHz elliptical cavity from Fer-\nmilab.

        "GHZ COATED CAVITY COLD TESTS": "A much higher frequency, simplified quarter wave \nresonator was developed on a limited LDRD budget to \nfurther develop this technology for this geometry. A 1 GHz \ncavity was fabricated at Argonne and coated at Fermilab, \nand subseqeuently cold tested at Argonne. Testing was \nlimited and results are shown below in Fig. 13. \n \nFigure 13: Q curve data for 1 GHz Nb3Sn QWR[5].  \nLow field Q was higher than expected for bare niobium \nat this high frequency, but still less than expected for \nNb3Sn. The cavity coating has been stripped and was \nrecoated, and now awaits cold testing. See paper TUC04 \nfor additional details [5].",
        "LESSONS LEARNED": "Prototyping of geometries not previously Nb3Sn coated \nhas led to many developments to cavity design and changes \nfrom previous bare niobium techniques.  \nThe coating ârecipesâ being followed are still being re-\nfined, and we anticipated applying the coating process to a \nnew geometry may require multiple coatings to achieve \nsuccess. In addition, we have first-hand experience that the \ncoated niobium yields easily and can result in a ruined \ncoating. Typically, the cavity can be strengthened by a he-\nlium jacket, a standard step in cavity fabrication. Unfortu-\nnately, the coating process precludes using common jack-\neting materials (stainless steel, titanium), so if a jacketed \ncavityâs coating was broken it would have to be cut out of \nits jacket. \nOur current approach has been to avoid helium jacketing \nfor this reason. This required building in additional gussets \nto avoid mechanical damage to the softened niobium. \nWelded gusset plates and an external titanium cage have \nprovided ",
        "FUTURE WORK": "We anticipate installation of this 145 MHz re-buncher \ncavity into ATLAS in the next two years. We are in the pro-\ncess of completing two additional 145 MHz cavities, \nwhich will provide additional learning opportunities to de-\nvelop this technology for low-beta geometries. We hope to \ncontinue fabricating prototypes of higher frequencies and \nadditional geometries such as a half wave resonator.",
        "CONCLUSION": "Multiple prototype Nb3Sn quarter wave cavities have \nbeen fabricated, coated, and tested. Multiple failures and \nrecent success with high performing coatings have pro-\nvided learning opportunities on how to successfully build, \ncoat, handle, and tune these cavities.",

Meanwhile,\napproximately 20â40% of the primary beam power is de-\nposited in the target, necessitating efficient heat dissipation.\nCurrently, FRIB operates at a primary beam power of 20 kW.\nTo enhance thermal dissipation efficiency, a single-slice ro-\ntating graphite target with a diameter of approximately 30 cm\nis employed.

For\nthis metric, the selected approach is focused on the power\nrequired for operation. We will evaluate and compare the\nelectrical power consumption with and without the iSAS\ntechnology under similar conditions. The comparison will\nbe performed for different use cases (specific to each tech-\nnology), but always under similar conditions for each tech-\nnology to ensure a fair comparison [2]. In addition, a con-\nsumption model of the PERLE ERL will be developed to\nevaluate the accelerator efficiency.",
        "ELECTRIC FAST REACTIVE\nTUNER": "In WP1 led by HZB, a fast-tuning system is developed to\ncompensate detuning due to mechanical vibrations or beam\ninduced transients, which are both usually compensated by\nadding a significant power overhead. Ferro-Electric Fast\nReactive Tuners (FE-FRTs) are an alternative to classic me-\nchanical cavity tuners (piezo). They form a coupled system\nof cavity and a typically coaxial line with ferro-electric mate-\nrial. The permittivity of this material is changed by applying\nhigh voltage, thus generating a change of impedance allow-\ning to control the resonance frequency of the coupled system\non a very fast time scale (â¼100 ns with a tuning range in the\ntens of kHz) [3,4]. FE-FRTs require an additional RF port\nto install on the cavity, but avoid complex control algorithms\nneeded to take into account the highly resonant mechanical-",
        "SMART LLRF": "In WP2 led by DESY, an optimized Low-Level Radio\nFrequency (LLRF) system is developed in order to reduce\nthe RF power required to drive the cavities, thanks to an\nefficient control of cavity field and detuning. To minimize\nthe RF power, cavities must operate at a quality factor Qext\nas high as possible, at a narrower bandwidth. But these\nconditions make resonance control extremely challenging\nand will only reduce the RF power needs if the resonance\ncan be properly guaranteed. So, the challenge is to find the\nhighest Qext (â¼QL) while meeting resonance control goals\nand without compromising operability or reliability. AI will\nbe integrated in this smart LLRF. Moreover, FE-FRT will\nalso help to reach high values of Qext.\nSince a LLRF system is constantly required for cavity\nfield control, the system cannot be switched OFF for com-\nparison purposes. Yet, options of the optimized LLRF can\nbe switched ON/OFF or adjusted to evaluate their impact\non power consumption. Several factors of the LL",

The one-loop cooling\nscheme is selected as it is about 2.5 times energetically more\nefficient than the two-loop scheme. It is important to note\nthat the energy saving obtainable with the one-loop cooling\nscheme with helium is strictly connected with the helium\ninlet temperature in the double-walled tube, which should\nbe as close as possible to the design value of 5 K.\nTo complete the design work performed on the FPC it-\nself, analyzing the data from the ESS cryomodule provides\nvaluable feedback to further optimize the FPC system by\nimproving the thermal insulation of the cryogenic line to the"

        "USA": "Abstract \nSince starting the user operation of Facility for Rare Iso-\ntope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan State University in May \n2022, the driver linac has provided more than a dozen ion \nbeam species from Oxygen to Uranium to the production \ntarget. FRIB routinely provided 20 kW primary beams on \ntarget since March 2025, which is a factor of 20 higher than \nat the beginning of the scientific user operation. In this \npresentation, the recent progress of FRIB driver linac beam \ndevelopment, a discussion of efficient primary beam tun-\ning procedures based on physics applications, and acceler-\nator improvement projects for low-loss accelerator will be \ndiscussed.",
        "INTRODUCTION": "FRIB is a heavy ion accelerator facility constructed at \nMichigan State University under the corporate agreement \nwith the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science to \nsupport the Office of Nuclear Physics mission. The facility \nis comprised of the driver linac, fragment separator, and \nexperimental area including 6 MeV/u reacceleator. Con-\nstruction was completed in January 2022, and user opera-\ntion started in May 2022. \nThe driver linac is designed to provide a 400 kW contin-\nuous wave beam to the production target [1]. The required \nprimary ions are generated in the Electron Cyclotron Res-\nonance (ECR) source, selected after a 90Â° bend, and trans-\nported to the accelerator tunnel through 24-meter-long \nLow Energy Beam Transport (LEBT). The beam is accel-\nerated by Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) and the fol-\nlowing three linac segments (LS1, LS2 and LS3). The \nbeam acceleration is provided by four types of Supercon-\nducting (SC) RF cavities with optimal Î² from 0.041 to 0.54. \nF",

        "NEW BEAM DEVELOPMENT": "The development of a new primary beam starts with a \npre-calculation of the accelerator setting by simulation \ntools. The RF cavitiesâ from MEBT to the target are calcu-\nlated by a model-based Instant Phase Setting (IPS) appli-\ncation [5]. The amplitude and synchronous phase of each \ncavity are optimized to meet the energy requirement and \nprovide sufficient stability area in the longitudinal phase \nspace. The calculated RF cavitiesâ settings are loaded to 3D \nbeam envelope code FLAME to calculate required focus-\ning fields. The solenoids in the acceleration segments LS1 \nand LS2 are set to provide the transverse phase advance per \nperiod below 90Â°. Then, five sections of quadrupoles (up-\nstream of the LS1, upstream of the LS2, upstream of the \nstripper, FS2 and BDS sections) are optimized to match \nCourant-Snyder (CS) parameters of all charge states sim-\nultaneously to the following beam optics. The magnetsâ \nsetting is registered to the application âSettings Managerâ \n[6] and matched",
        "RECENT PROGRESS WITH \nLINAC TUNING": "Since the start of the scientific user operation in May \n2022, the beam power of the driver linac has gradually in-\ncreased to 20 kW. Up to now, 13 stable isotope (18O, 22Ne, \n28Si, 36Ar, 40Ar, 48Ca, 58Ni, 64Zn, 70Zn, 82Se, 124Xe, 198Pt, and \n238U) beams have been accelerated up to 300 MeV/u and \ndelivered to the production target. In addition, seven iso-\ntope (16O, 40Ar, 86Kr, 107Ag, 129Xe, 169Tm, and 209Bi) beams \nhave been provided to the test station in the Single Event \nExperiment (SEE) beamline with energies ranging from 10 \nto 40 MeV/u. \nLithium Film Stage Feedback in Operation \nWe have observed the energy loss fluctuation at LLCS \nfrom the beginning of its operation. Figure 2 shows energy \nloss distribution for 124Xe and 238U beams. There are \n3 ~ 5 meta-stable states of the lithium film thickness \nquickly jumping from one to another in a 0.1 s time scale. \nThe energy feedback system has been developed, and it is \nin operation to stabilize the post-stripper energy and bunch \nti",
        "ACCELERATOR IMPROVEMENT \nPROJECTS": "Recent 20 kW operations with Ca, Ni, Zn, Se, Xe, and U \nbeams show that the linac's beam losses are tolerable for \n> 50 kW if they increase linearly with the beam intensity.",
        "RMS": "beam size in quadrupoles below Â¼ of aperture to avoid any \nbeam losses. The black line in Fig. 8 shows the correlation \nbetween beam size and the standard deviation of the thick-\nness of the beam spot when the average thickness on the \nbeam spot is 1.0 mg/cm2, which is evaluated using the \nthickness distribution measurements [3]. The RMS beam \nsize on the stripper film has typically been 0.5 mm in recent \noperations, \nand \nthe \nthickness \nnonuniformity \nis \n0.12 mg/cm2. The nonuniformity exponentially increases \nas a function of the beam size, so it is crucial to maintain \nbeam rms size on the stripper 0.5 mm or less. \nAs the beam intensity increases for higher power opera-\ntion, the beam emittance from the ECR ion source is pos-\nsibly larger. In preparation for the larger emittance, we are \nplanning to replace the 9 quadrupoles around the stripper \n(section âAâ in Fig. 1) to allow the beam size to be main-\ntained to a similar level or to enable further focusing of the \nbeam with small",
        "SUMMARY": "FRIB linac routinely delivers 20 kW ion beams to the \ntarget from oxygen to uranium.  We maintain uncontrolled \nbeam losses at the level of 10-4. At the current beam power \nlevel, these losses are well below 1 W/m which is an ac-\nceptable value for high power proton linacs. There is a hy-\npothesis that the beam losses in the superconducting cavi-\nties can cause field emissions. Therefore, we keep the beam \nlosses in the post-stripper linac about two orders of magni-\ntude lower than 1 W/m. Recently, accelerator tunes have \nbeen developed for 238U5q and 48Ca2q beams characterized \nby low beam losses and suitable for higher beam power. \nThe recent implementation of fast energy feedback and \nslow LLCS stage feedback reduced the beam losses in the",

Agustsson3, P. Davis1, G. Eremeev2, B. Guilfoyle1, M. Kedzie1, M.P. Kelly1, T. Petersen1, S. Posen2, T. Reid1, E. Spranza3, B. Tennis2 1Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, USA 2Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, IL, USA 3Radiabeam Technologies LLC, Santa Monica, CA, USA Abstract This work aims to demonstrate the feasibility of coating a high-frequency 1 GHz, compact niobium-3 tin (Nb3Sn) coated quarter-wave cavity for future ion accelerators. Nb3Sn has a BCS surface resistance up to 2 orders of mag- nitude lower than pure niobium widely used for SRF, which implies Nb3Sn cavitiesâ better performance at much higher frequencies than for niobium. This presents an op- portunity for transformative size reductions in accelerating cavities. Here, we have designed, built and tested a 1 GHz quarter-wave cavity sized similarly to a soda can. Cold tests have shown a critical temperatures of 14.5 K Â± 0.1 K, which might be due to the coating layer damage or tin de- pletion. Notably, we observed an average quality factor ~8E8 at low accelerating electric fields, ~7 times higher than the theoretical limit for pure niobium at this fre- quency. INTRODUCTION Niobium-3 Tin (Nb3Sn) is a promising alternative to pure niobium for low-beta ion accelerators due to its higher superconducting transition temperature of ~18 K and higher superheating field, and much lower RF losses even at high frequencies. At 4.5 K, the expected Bardeen- Cooper-Schrieffer resistance (BCS resistance) of Nb3Sn is a few nano-Ohms at 1 GHz, with two orders of magnitude improvement compared to pure niobium (see Fig. 1). The low Nb3Sn RF losses together with 18 K critical tempera- ture allow the use of higher frequency, much smaller cavi- ties while maintaining 4.5 K operation that is compatible with cryocoolers. This work aims to demonstrate the feasi- bility of coating a high-frequency 1 GHz, compact quarter- wave niobium cavity with Nb3Sn. The development of this cavity has the potential to transform low-beta ion acceler- ators through size reductions and by enabling the replace- ment of large helium cryoplants with small plug-in cry- ocoolers. We have designed, built, and tested a 1 GHz Nb3Sn coated quarter-wave cavity. Nb3Sn coating has been per- formed by vapor diffusion in a high vacuum furnace at Fer- milab. Cryogenic cold tests show a quality factor of ~8E8 at low accelerating electric fields, or ~7 times higher than the theoretical limit for pure niobium at 1 GHz. This first coating does not yet meet our quality factor or gradient goals. We have stripped the coating layer and elec- tropolished the cavity (~70 Î¼m removal) and have the cav- ity re-coated at Fermilab. Cold tests for the second coating will take place shortly. Figure 1: SRIMP calculated BCS resistance of Nb3Sn and Niobium vs frequency at 4.5 K with material parameters from [1]. PROTOTYPE DESIGN AND FABRICATION The cavity design was aimed to demonstrate the perfor- mance of Nb3Sn coated low-beta quarter-wave cavity at ~1 GHz using the simplest possible design in this first study. The dimensions of the cavity are shown in Fig. 2(a). For simplicity, beam ports are neglected. A stainless-steel flange with RF drive and pick-up probes close the bottom of the cavity. RF losses in the stainless steel are minimized by extending the single port at the bottom of the cavity. EM simulation (Fig. 2(b)) gives a geometry factor of 49.8, peak electric field and peak magnetic field of 147 MV/m and 308 mT, respectively, for a stored energy of 1 J. The 1 GHz prototype cavity was machined at Radia- Beam from two high purity (RRR~300) niobium cylindri- cal ingots (2.5ââ OD, one 3ââ long and the other 4.5ââ long). The two parts (Fig. 2(c)) were electron beam welded (Fig. 2(d)) after buffered chemical processing. The fin- ished cavity is roughly the size of a soda can. __________________________________________ * Work supported by Argonne LDRD seed funding award under the LDRD number 2024-0374 and the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Nuclear Physics, under Contract No. DE-AC02- 06CH11357.

Nb3Sn COATING The cavity received bulk electropolishing process to re- move more than 100 Î¼m of the niobium inside the cavity. The mirror finish is shown in Fig. 3(a). It was then ano- dized with a 30 V DC power supply, creating a niobium- oxide layer that appears blue. The cavity was ultrasonic cleaned and high-pressure rinsed to remove particulates, as for standard niobium. The Nb3Sn coating was performed by vapor diffusion in a small vacuum furnace at Fermilab. The tin sources are heated in a crucible near the cavity port. A detailed vapor diffusion Nb3Sn coating procedure can be found in [2]. The coating inside the cavity is shown in Fig. 3(b). Figure 3: (a) Post-electropolishing cavity surface finish; (b) Post-coating cavity surface. COATED CAVITY COLD TESTING After coating the cavity, it was again high pressure rinsed and assembled in the clean room with the stainless-steel flange using indium seals. Four cold tests have been done. After the first cold test in October 2024, it was dissembled and high pressure rinsed. We re-assembled the cavity and performed another three cold tests in January and February",

        "INTRODUCTION": "Niobium-3 Tin (Nb3Sn) is a promising alternative to \npure niobium for low-beta ion accelerators due to its higher \nsuperconducting transition temperature of ~18 K and \nhigher superheating field, and much lower RF losses even \nat high frequencies. At 4.5 K, the expected Bardeen-\nCooper-Schrieffer resistance (BCS resistance) of Nb3Sn is \na few nano-Ohms at 1 GHz, with two orders of magnitude \nimprovement compared to pure niobium (see Fig. 1). The \nlow Nb3Sn RF losses together with 18 K critical tempera-\nture allow the use of higher frequency, much smaller cavi-\nties while maintaining 4.5 K operation that is compatible \nwith cryocoolers. This work aims to demonstrate the feasi-\nbility of coating a high-frequency 1 GHz, compact quarter-\nwave niobium cavity with Nb3Sn. The development of this \ncavity has the potential to transform low-beta ion acceler-\nators through size reductions and by enabling the replace-\nment of large helium cryoplants with small plug-in cry-\nocoolers.  \nWe have desig",
        "OVERVIEW": "Plasma processing is done with the cavities at room tem-\nperature. Major challenges for FRIB cavities are the FPC\nmismatch at room temperature, the absence of higher-order\nmode (HOM) couplers, and the limited view of the cavity\ninterior through access ports. Ignition of plasma in the FPC\nrather than in the cavity is a concern, as this would risk dam-\nage to the FPC or cavity. Damage to the RF window ceramic\nafter plasma generation was observed at IMP [11]; in two\nearly trials with a FRIB HWR, sputtering of copper from\nthe custom-length input antenna onto the niobium RF port\nwas observed after coupler plasma ignition [9,10].",
        "APPARATUS AND METHODS": "Most of the development work has been done using a\nneon-oxygen plasma at â¼100 mTorr.

We use a bias T to monitor the dc current\nfrom the input coupler and apply a dc bias if desired. We\nmonitor the resonant frequency with a network analyzer.

Cheney and colleagues at IJCLab found that the coupler\nignition threshold could be raised by applying a negative\ndc bias to the coupler antenna [12].

        "CONCLUSION": "Here, we designed, built and tested a 1 GHz quarter-\nwave niobium cavity coated with Nb3Sn by vapor diffu-\nsion. Several cryogenic cold tests were performed at Ar-\ngonne. The measured superconducting transition tempera-\nture was 14.5 K Â± 0.1 K, which is lower than 18 K. Notably, \nwe also observed an average quality factor ~8E8 at low ac-\ncelerating electric fields (<0.3 MV/m), ~7 times of the the-\noretical limit for pure niobium at 1 GHz. The cavity has \nbeen stripped and recoated with the aim of improving both \nthe Q and the accelerating gradient, with cold tests coming \nshortly. The development of this high-frequency compact \ncavity has the potential to transform low-beta ion acceler-\nators, through dramatic size reductions and by enabling the \nreplacement of large helium cryoplants with a distributed \nset of small plug-in cryocoolers, lowering overall costs and \nremoving one of the major single point failures in modern \nsuperconducting linacs.",

        "INTRODUCTION": "The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is a major \nnuclear physics facility for research with fast, stopped, and \nreaccelerated rare isotope beams. FRIB will provide access \nto 80% of all isotopes predicted to exist in nature. FRIB \nconstruction started in 2013 and began operations in 2022. \nThe FRIB facility is based on a heavy-ion continuous wave \n(CW) superconducting driver linac, capable of accelerating \nuranium ions to 200 MeV/u and higher energies for lighter \nions with 400 kW power striking a target to produce rare \nisotope beams. FRIB has adopted an incremental approach \ntoward the ultimate design beam power of 400 kW by pri-\noritizing safe operation and to avoid any damage to the ma-\nchine. In the delivery beam system, the beam dump is de-\nsigned to absorb approximately 75% of the primary beam \npower.

        "BEAM DUMP OPTIMIZATION": "The introduction of the 6-degree Mini-Channel Beam \nDump (MCBD) (Fig. 5) for Epoch 2 afforded an oppor-\ntunity to further the development of the 6-degreee absorber \ndesign. This optimization focused on material selection \nand cooling area geometry. \n \nFigure 5: 6-degree mini-channel beam dump design for \n20 kW. \nMini-Channel Beam Dump: Design Choices \nThe copper-chromium-zirconium (C18150) material se-\nlection used in the manufacture of the bi-metal absorber \nplates was chosen for its high thermal conductivity, yield \nstrength, radiation resistance and use in similar applica-\ntions. The thermal conductivity of the absorber plate was \nenhanced by machining cooling channels into the alumin-\nium layer of the bi-metal absorber plate. An aluminium \nbacking plate was electron beam welded to the bi-metal ab-\nsorber plate establishing a vacuum tight pressure boundary. \nThe bi-metal absorber assembly also prevents copper al-\nloys from coming into direct contact with the cooling \nwater.

This \nmethod provides a binary pass/fail criterion and therefore \nan extremely objective assessment. Protection against local \nfailure was assessed by Elastic Plastic analysis. Also con-\nsidered, was the protection against the collapse from buck-\nling and protection from cyclic loading - which includes \nfatigue and ratcheting analysis [6]. The 6-degree MCBD \nsuccessfully passed the BPVC application and analysis in-\ndicated areas for future improvement. \n6-degree Optimized Mini-Channel Static Beam \nDump: 30 kW and Beyond \nThe 6-degree MCBD was further optimized in support \nof Epoch 3 as shown in Fig. 7.

        "CONCLUSION": "The static beam dump design has served FRIB well \nthrough Epoch 2 of the power ramp up: 20 kW. The design \nhas gradually improved with operational experience and \nlessons learned. The mini-channel beam dump design uti-\nlized a BPVC based approach to objectively qualify the de-\nvice acceptability for use. Code application to the initial \ndesign revealed several optimizations that could be made \nto the initial mini-channel beam dump design. These opti-\nmizations are introduced into the current design and will \nbe further validated by e-beam testing. The current design \nwill be used in Epoch 3 with beam power expected up to \n50 kW. This device will be installed for operation in the \nsecond half of 2025."

        "DESIGN AND EXPERIMENTAL THERMAL VALIDATION OF THE": "MINI-CHANNEL BEAM DUMP FOR FRIB â\nJ. Songâ , N. Bultman, T. Kanemura, G. Lee,\nS. Miller, M. Patil, R. Quispe-Abad, M. Reaume, J. Wei\nFacility for Rare Isotope Beams, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA\nAbstract\nThe FRIB, a leading experimental nuclear physics facility,\nproduces high-intensity beams of proton- and neutron-rich\nnuclei. FRIB provides high-yield, high-purity rare isotope\nbeams via primary beams interactions with a graphite tar-\nget. After the target, the unreacted primary beam should\nbe absorbed by a beam dump. To support operations at 20\nkW, an intermediate beam dump system, called the mini-\nchannel beam dump (MCBD), has been developed and im-\nplemented. This system features a static structure oriented\nat a 60 angle, reducing power density by 10 times. The",
        "MCBD": "to monitor internal temperatures.\nuncertainty is conservatively estimated to be approximately\n5 %.\nHere, surface thermal data from a 17 keV, 15 kW electron\nbeam incident on the MCBD were compared at two different\nlocations. Thermal images shown in panels a) and b) of\nFig. 3 were used to extract temperature profiles along the\nx and y axes. The measured temperatures along the x and\ny direction for a beam centered on the absorber are plotted\nin panels c) and d), respectively.

The center profiles show ex-\ncellent agreement with the simulations, however, at the right\nedge, the simulations tend to underestimate the measured\ntemperature. These deviations are likely due to the lower\ndetection",
        "INTRODUCTION": "FRIB is a major nuclear physics facility dedicated to rare\nisotope science and is progressing toward its ultimate goal of\n400 kW primary beam operation. FRIB currently provides\nstable heavy ion beams ranging from oxygen to uranium\nand has been progressively increasing its operational beam\npower from 1 kW to 20 kW [1,2]. Following commission-\ning [3,4], a static aluminum beam dump was used for primary\nbeam powers ranging from 1 to 10 kW [5]. Approximately\n20â40 % of the primary beam power is absorbed by the\ngraphite production target, while the remaining 60â80 %\nmust be absorbed by the downstream beam dump system.\nDue to the limited thermal performance of the static dump\nbeyond 10 W, the need for an intermediate beam dump, re-\nferred to as the mini-channel beam dump (MCBD) [6], was\nestablished. Key changes compared to the previous beam\ndump include the use of 2 mm-wide mini-channels on the\nwater-cooling side, increasing the average convective heat\ntransfer coefficient (CHTC) by more tha",
        "CHANNEL BEAM DUMP": "The main design considerations were to enhance ther-\nmal performance and minimize the operational impact of\nradiation damage on the beam dump. To improve thermal\nperformance, a copper alloy was introduced, offering â2.5\ntimes higher thermal conductivity than Al2219. This mate-\nrial change allowed an increase in the maximum allowable\ntemperature from 200 0C to 250 0C, based on thermal stress\nanalysis results. A 2 mm-wide mini-channel design was se-\nlected to achieve a CHTC approximately 3 times higher than\nthe previous desgin, while maintaining a reasonable pres-\nsure drop (â1 bar). Radiation damage is a critical concern,\nespecially near the surface, as the FRIB primary beam stops\nwhithin less than 1 mm from the surface. Since beam dump\nis not a beam window, and some surface damage may oc-\ncur, the system is expected to remain fully functional under\noperational conditions. Additional structural analyses were\nperformed to ensure safe operation under expected thermal\nloads [10].\nFigure 1:",

        "EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION": "WITH E-BEAM\nThis experiment aims to demonstrate the thermal perfor-\nmance of the mini-channel beam dump (MCBD) prototype\nunder operational conditions. Validation of the MCBD de-\nsign is achieved by comparing measured temperatures with\nsimulation results. A thermal analysis model using ANSYS\nwas developed [7], and modified the average CHTC for the\nexperimental validation test because the cooling water flow\nrate is fixed at 40 gpm. MCBD was installed inside the\ne-beam chamber shown in Fig. 2, where the vacuum level\nwas maintained below 1Ã10â4 torr. A 17 keV electron beam\nwas used to irradiate the MCBD at various power levels and\nbeam sizes. The cooling water flow rate was maintained at\n40 gpm, with an inlet temperature of 30 0C. The pressure\ndrop across the MCBD was â17 psi. An IR camera was\ninstalled above the chamber to measure the surface tempera-\nture through an IR window with a transmission coefficient\nof 0.78 at the operating spectral wavelength.

        "CONCLUSION": "The experimental results demonstrate that the mini-\nchannel beam dump (MCBD) prototype performs reliably\nunder simulated operational conditions. Surface tempera-\nture measurements at two different locations on the MCBD\nshowed good agreement with thermal simulations, with dis-\ncrepancies within Â±5 %. Internal temperature measurements\nusing embedded thermocouples also showed reasonable\nagreement, with deviations of 10-20 % attributed to un-\ncertainties in thermocouple placement depth.

Simon\nFacility of Rare Isotope Beams, Michgan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA\nAbstract\nTo intercept unwanted charge states from stripped beams\nwith high power densities, an advanced charge selector is\ncurrently under development at the Facility for Rare Isotope\nBeams (FRIB). This upgraded charge selector is designed\nto intercept beam spots that have a power of up to 5 kW and\nan rms size as small as 0.7 mm Ã 1.25 mm. To enhance heat\ndissipation and mitigate thermal stress, rotating graphite\nwheels are employed as the beam-intercepting medium.\nAn essential aspect of this design is the development of\na robust vacuum system to ensure reliable and efficient op-\neration while minimizing beam losses in downstream sec-\ntions. The high graphite temperature, maintained over 1000\nâC for radiation damage annealing during operation, raised\nconcerns about gas load. To aid the vacuum system de-\nsign, vac",
        "INTRODUCTION": "The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), supported\nby the U.S. Department of Energyâs Office of Science, is\na cutting-edge user facility dedicated to advancing nuclear\nscience. FRIB has progressively increased its primary beam\npower from 1 kW to 20 kW since commencing operations in\n2022 [1]. The facility is currently being upgraded to 50 kW\noperation, with the charge selector as one of the key devices\nunder development [2].\nThe charge selector is located in the first folding segment\nof the accelerator and is responsible for intercepting un-\nwanted charge states produced after the beam stripper. Fig-\nure 1 shows the positions of the charge stripper and the\ncharge selector.\nFigure 1: Layout of folding segment of the FRIB linac.\nâThis material is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of\nEnergy, Office of Science, Office of Nuclear Physics and used resources of\nthe Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) Operations, which is a DOE\nOffice of Science User Facility under Award Nu",
        "CHARGE SELECTOR": "The advanced charge selector employs a pair of rotating\ngraphite wheel that intercept unwanted charge states and\nradiate absorbed beam power to a water-cooled copper-alloy\nheat exchanger. Graphite is chosen mainly for its excellent\nthermal shock and radiation resistance, similar to its use in\nhigh-power target systems. Rotation spreads the heat load\nover a larger volume and surface area, reducing localized\nthermal stress and enabling high-power operation.\nFigure 2 presents a model of the advanced charge selec-\ntor. As shown in the figure, the graphite wheels are posi-\ntioned within a heat exchanger to intercept the beams. The\ndevice employs ferrofluid rotary feedthroughs for torque\ntransmission and linear actuators for positioning to intercept\nunwanted charge states across the beam profile. The device\nis shielded to reduce radiation exposure to the surrounding\nenvironment. The device incorporates complex features to\nensure safe operation and maintenance [4].",

        "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION": "Once the simulation reached convergence, the pressure\nprofiles were obtained. For nitrogen, the maximum partial\npressure is 1.5 Ã 10â8 mbar near the graphite wheel, assum-\ning a pumping speed of 80 L/s. Increasing the pumping\nspeed to 120 L/s and 180 L/s resulted in a slight reduction\nof the maximum pressure to 1.1 Ã 10â8 mbar and 7.7 Ã 10â9\nmbar, respectively, indicating diminishing returns with fur-\nther increases in pumping speed.\nFigure 5 shows the partial pressure distribution of carbon\nwith a sticking factor of 0.01 applied to the chamber surface,\nwhile the pumping effects of the beam ports and ion pump\nare disabled. The peak partial pressure of carbon is observed\nas 2.9 Ã 10â7 mbar near the graphite wheel, gradually de-\ncreasing with distance. A transparent reference surface was\ncreated to obtain the pressure profile along the beam path.\nAccording to Eq. (3), the equivalent volumetric pumping\nspeed of the chamber surfaces reaches approximately 1800\nL/s with a sticking factor of ",
        "CONCLUSION": "Monte Carloâbased simulations of the vacuum system for\nthe advanced charge selector were performed using MolFlow,\naccounting for thermal outgassing of nitrogen, carbon sub-\nlimation and pumping speed. In the simulation, the partial\npressures of carbon and nitrogen are 2 and 3 orders of mag-\nnitude lower than the maximum operating beamline vacuum\npressure of 2 Ã 10â5 Torr, respectively, demonstrating that\nthe design meets the requirements for operating the linac.\nFurthermore, simulations considering carbon sticking to the\nchamber surfaces demonstrate that even a 1% sticking prob-\nability results in significant effective pumping. As a result,\nthe ion pumpâs contribution to carbon removal is negligible."

        "CONCLUSION": "Plasma ignition threshold RF fields for several FRIB cavi-\nties have been predicted using a diffusion-dominated plasma\nmodel. Predictions based on numerical calculations of the\neffective diffusion length predict lower ignition thresholds\nthan those based on analytic approximations. Comparisons\nwith plasma measurements show that the predicted ignition\nthresholds are in reasonable agreement with measured ex-\ntinction thresholds; the measured ignition thresholds are\nsignificantly higher than predicted. The simple diffusion-\ndominated model does not provide a quantitative explanation\nfor this discrepancy.\nThe diffusion-dominated model could be used to predict\nignition thresholds for other cavity shapes and could provide\nguidance for future plasma processing development work,\nthough we can expect the measured ignition thresholds to\nbe higher than predicted.\nA more general model may be needed for accurate predic-\ntions of coupler ignition; for the case of FRIB fundamental\npower couplers, the",

        "INTRODUCTION": "Careful surface preparation is needed for superconducting\nradio-frequency (SRF) cavities to ensure high performance\nin particle accelerators. Though SRF cavity assembly is done\nin a clean room, some particulate contamination may still be\nintroduced. When a cavity is installed in a cryomodule and\nused for acceleration, there is a risk of further contamination.\nHydrocarbons on the cavity inner surface may lower the\nwork function and worsen field emission [1]. Field emission\ncan produce Bremsstrahlung X-rays, and, in severe cases,\ncan reduce the cavity quality factor, such that the accelerating\ngradient of the accelerator must be reduced.\nIn-situ cavity cleaning techniques are highly desirable for\nreduction of contamination and improvement of performance\nwithout the need to remove and disassemble cryomodules,\nwhich is time- and labor-intensive.\nPlasma processing has been developed as a method to re-\nmove contamination from SRF cavities via a weakly-ionized\ncold plasma. This is done by flo",
        "DOMINATED MODEL": "Plasmas within certain parameter ranges can be described\napproximately by a diffusion-dominated model [4]. The\ndiffusion-dominated model is applicable for plasma ignition\nin FRIB cavities, and has been used to predict ignition thresh-\nolds for FRIB QWRs. However, the modelâs assumptions\nare not met for the case of plasma ignition in the FRIB funda-\nmental power coupler (FPC), as the electron mean free path\nis not small compared to the relevant FPC dimensions [5].\nThe Diffusion Equation\nIn order to predict the plasma ignition threshold field\nð¸ð¡for a given cavity geometry, driving frequency, and gas\nmixture, it is necessary to properly describe the behavior of\nelectrons as ionizing particles. The effective diffusion length\nÎ describes the average distance traveled by ionizing elec-\ntrons before they are re-combined into neutral material [6].\nA kinetics-based derivation of the effective diffusion length\nrelies on the eigen-solution to a simplified Fickâs Law diffu-\nsion equation [7]:\nâ2ð=",

        "CONCLUSION AND\nFUTURE PERSPECTIVES": "In this study, we presented the current progress in the\ndevelopment of automatic beam tuning at RIBF, with a\nparticular focus on the use of charge-converted particles\nto establish reliable indicators for high-intensity beams, as\nwell as the introduction of Safe Line Bayesian Optimiza-\ntion (Safe LineBO) as a safety-aware optimization frame-\nwork. Looking ahead, we aim to implement these algorithms\nin the actual system and further enhance the optimization\nprocess by incorporating techniques such as variational au-\ntoencoders [10], toward efficient and safe high-dimensional\nparameter optimization for high-intensity heavy ion beams.",

Therefore, regularizing the emittance fitting based\non a prior belief of the emittance can help mitigate unrealis-\ntically large inference errors.\nFigure 3: Degeneracy of CS solutions based on BPMQ mea-\nsurements from the LS3 exit to the BDS entrance segment.\nThe three colors represent different CS solutions at the LS3\nexit, all producing nearly identical BPMQ values (average\ndeviation < 0.5 ðð2) at BPMs, while the differences in RMS\nbeam sizes are noticeable and measurable using the profile\nmonitor (resolution < 0.1 mm). Notably, the emittance dif-\nference between solutions can be as much as a factor of two.\nIncorporating a prior on emittance can help resolve such\nambiguities in CS reconstruction.\nFurther improvements to CS reconstruction can be\nachieved by incorporating a few profile monitor (PM) scans,\nwhich are slower but more accurate.

        "BEAM TEST": "Recent beam tests have shown promising results. To re-\nduce computation time, the surrogate model for BAL was\ninitialized after conducting 8 random quadrupole scans (q-\nscans). In each q-scan, BPMQ values were recorded from\n16 BPMs using BPMQ VD. Although only six parameters\nare fitted during CS reconstruction, measurement errors can\nintroduce uncertainty into the reconstructed CS parameters.\nThis uncertainty is leveraged when selecting q-scans to query.\nUsing BAL, we queried 2 additional q-scans for BPMQ mea-\nsurements and 1 additional q-scan for a PM measurement.\nFigure 4 shows the final CS solutions, where all ensemble\nmembers have converged to a unique solution with a mis-\nmatch factor of approximately 0.2 compared to the reference\nsolution. The reference solution was obtained using a sepa-\nrate q-scan procedure with PM measurements, which is the\nstandard method traditionally used for CS reconstruction.\nFigure 4: Final ensemble of BPMQ based CS solution.

        "INTRODUCTION": "The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan \nState University (MSU) is a scientific user facility for the \nU.S. Department of Energy Office of Science (DOE-SC), \nwith financial support from and furthering the mission of \nthe DOE-SC Office of Nuclear Physics. The FRIB driver \nlinac was designed to accelerate stable ion beams exceed-\ning 200 MeV/u with superconducting cavities and provide \na beam power up to 400 kW. User operations commenced \nin May 2022, and the linac currently operates at beam pow-\ners of up to 20 kW [1]. \nReducing beam losses is one of the biggest challenges as \nbeam power increases. A recent beam study observed the \nbeam loss in Linac Segment 2 (LS2, Fig. 1) due to an en-\nergy spread increase caused by the lithium stripper [2]. To \nincrease the longitudinal acceptance, we plan to operate \ntwo 161-MHz normal conducting multigap bunchers \n(MGBs, Fig. 1) at higher voltages and introduce new sec-\nond harmonic RF cavities [3]. \nFigure 1: Layout of FRIB driver l",
        "COMMISSIONING GOALS": "The primary goal was to verify that both MGBs operated \nstably. Secondary goals included evaluating interlock set-\ntings, assessing the accuracy of RF power readbacks, mon-\nitoring long-term stability, and investigating other factors \nrelevant to user operation. Major criteria were as follows: \nâ¢ Stable cavity operation for over one hour without trips\nat the highest operating voltages\nâ¢ Vacuum pressure rise less than 1Ã10-6 Torr and as low\nas reasonably achievable during startup\nThe second one was defined to prevent the issue encoun-\ntered during the initial stages of operation. Multiple \nstartup failures occurred due to vacuum spikes in the",

Mustapha, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, USA\nP. Snopok, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA\nAbstract\nBeam instabilities and resonances affect the transverse dy-\nnamics in particle accelerators and, when encountered, can\ntrigger emittance growth and beam loss. Resonance lines\noriginate from non-linear elements and effects in the lattice,\nimposing strict constraints on the choice of working points\nand narrowing the available tune space. Circular modes are\nround coupled beams with non-zero angular momentum,\nprovide an alternative beam motion and dynamics. In this\nstudy, we derive the third-order sextupole resonance con-\nditions in the coupled (normal-mode) parametrization and\nshow that, with circular-mode lattice design and beam oper-\nation, most of these resonance lines are naturally suppressed\ndue to the inherent flatness of the mode.",
        "INTRODUCTION": "Accelerators aim to deliver high-quality beams depend-\ning on the objectives to be accomplished. The design of an\naccelerator depends on the beam species to be accelerated\nand the desired energy and intensity. An accelerator lattice\ndesign incorporates both linear and non-linear elements and\ncollective effects. Linear elements are responsible for the\ntotal number of betatron oscillations, known as the tunes\nof the system in orthogonal planes. The inclusion of non-\nlinear elements introduces systematic resonances within the\nlattice, as discussed in many textbooks [1]. The Courant-\nSnyder parameterization of the betatron motion [2] shed\nlight on the periodic behavior of the beam and the resonance\nconditions. Uncontrolled resonances may lead to particle\nloss; therefore, resonance conditions constrain the selection\nof tune. Collective effects, such as space charge, also pro-\nduce resonance conditions [3]. Non-linear static magnetic\nelements are used for corrections in accelerators. For exa",

        "DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH TEMPERATURE OVENS FOR SOLID ION": "BEAM PRODUCTION AT FACILITY FOR RARE ISOTOPE BEAMS (FRIB)â\nH. Chengâ , J. Guo, G. Machicoane, X. Rao, M. Hu, A. Plastun, L. Tobos, R. Rencsok, J. Backlas\nFacility for Rare Isotope Beams, East Lansing, MI, United States\nAbstract\nInductive ovens are integral to Electron Cyclotron Res-\nonance Ion Source (ECRIS), facilitating the generation of\nhigh-intensity solid ion beams. At the Facility for Rare Iso-\ntope Beams (FRIB), specialized inductive High Temperature\nOven (HTO) has been developed to ensure the stable, con-\nsistent, and reliable production of solid ion beams for the\nHigh-Power ECR (HPECR) ion source. These HTOs have\nsuccessfully supported the operation of various solid ion\nbeams, including Silicon, Nickel, and Uranium. In align-\nment with the FRIB beam power ramp-up objectives, future\nrequirements will include increased beam currents and pro-\nlonged operational durations for more species. To optimize",
        "INTRODUCTION": "With the ongoing advancement of modern heavy-ion ac-\ncelerator systems, there is an increasing demand for ion\nsources capable of delivering high-intensity, high-quality,\nand high-charge-state ion beams to ensure the production of\naccelerated ion beams with sufficiently high energy. These\nbeams are increasingly pivotal in various scientific domains,\nincluding nuclear physics, atomic physics, and other inter-\ndisciplinary applications [1â4].\nA primary method for producing such high-quality ion\nbeams is through super conducting Electron Cyclotron Res-\nonance Ion Sources (ECRIS). To achieve stable and intense\nbeam production, ECRIS systems require a metal vapor pres-\nsure of approximately 10â3 torr. This vapor pressure is con-\ntingent upon the temperature of the evaporant material, with\nspecific temperatures necessary to attain the desired vapor\npressures for various metals, 586 Â°C for Bismuth, 616 Â°C\nfor Lead, 1371 Â°C for Nickel, 1896 Â°C for Platinum, and\n2258 Â°C for Molybdenum [5]. To me",
        "OVEN DEVELOPMENT": "The HTO comprises several integral components, includ-\ning induction coils, a susceptor (crucible), thermal insulation,\na water-cooling system, a heating station, and an alternating\ncurrent (AC) power supply. Prior research has demonstrated\nthe successful production of approximately 52 eÂµA 238ð35+\nion beams with ðð2 at an oven temperature of 2000 Â°C [6].\nTo ensure the stable generation of vapor from the HTO,\nmaintaining a uniform temperature distribution inside the\nsusceptor is essential. During a one-week test at 2000 Â°C\nwith uranium dioxide contained in the oven susceptor, par-\ntial blockage of the susceptorâs front nozzle was observed.\nThis was attributed to the condensation of uranium vapor,\nwhich originated from within the susceptor. In the initial\noven design, the temperature peaked at the center of the sus-\nceptor, leading to preferential vaporization of the material\nin this region. The resulting vapor flux was directed toward\nboth ends of the susceptor, where it ultimately cond",

        "ANSYS SIMULATIONS": "Multiple ANSYS simulations were performed with the\nobjectives of (a) optimizing the temperature distribution to\nensure uniformity throughout the susceptor interior, and (b)\nachieving a wide range of attainable temperatures within\nthe oven susceptor. In these ANSYS simulations, the water-\ncooled copper coils are consistently maintained at ambient\ntemperature. Heat generation within the susceptor arises\nfrom the power induced by these coils. Radiative and con-\nductive heat losses are considered significant in the thermal\nanalysis, while convective losses are deemed negligible due\nto the HTO operating under high-vacuum conditions, typi-\ncally in the range of 10â9 to 10â6 torr.\nThermal Distribution\nCompared to the original HTO design, the susceptor\nlength has been reduced, and an additional ceramic ring\nhas been installed on each side of the susceptor to enhance\nits positional stability in the updated configuration.

        "TEST RESULTS AND DISCUSSION": "The inductively heated HTO was subjected to a series of\nrigorous offline evaluations using a controlled test bench to\ninvestigate two key aspects: (a) whether a shortened sus-\nceptor configuration enhances thermal uniformity within\nthe oven susceptor, and (b) whether variations in susceptor\nwall thickness facilitates a broader operational temperature\nrange. The empirical results obtained from these experi-\nments demonstrated strong agreement with the predictive\nmodels generated through ANSYS simulations, with devia-\ntions falling within an acceptable margin of error.\nThermal Distribution\nTemperature profiling of the HTO was conducted under\ntwo distinct configurations on an offline test bench.

Morris, S. Zhao Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA Abstract The FRIB RFQ runs in continuous wave mode at",
        "80.5 MHz with input power up to 110 kW. Although relia- bility of the current tetrode amplifier has been greatly im- proved during commissioning and early operations, some potential failures may cause long repair time and compro- mise overall system availability. FRIB is commissioning a 120 kW solid-state RF amplifier system that uses the same 2 kW modules as FRIB linear segment 1. The paper will detail the design and commissioning of this system INTRODUCTION Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is a heavy ion linear accelerator (linac) facility that came online follow- ing the completion of technical construction in April 2022. The FRIB driver linac includes 6 room temperature cavi- ties and 324 superconducting (SC) cavities (housed in 46 cryomodules). During the first three years of user oper- ations, the FRIB complex has safely accelerated more than a dozen different primary beams ranging from 16O to 238U to beam energies ~200 MeV/u [1]. FRIB single event effects (FSEE) facility is a purpose- built beamline at the end of the linac segment 1 (LS1) with experimental station and user control room with complete diagnostic equipment and controls. The dedicated FSEE experimental area allows users to test the effects of radia- tion on their devices to make sure they are safe for com- mercial and scientific use. FSEE facility uses the linear par- ticle accelerator to accelerate ions to the proper specifica- tions that can best match space radiation conditions. A tetrode amplifier was originally chosen for the RFQ cavity due to the high RF power requirements. The tetrode amplifier was designed and fabricated based on in-house expertise of RF coaxial resonator amplifier systems from NSCL and the ReA3 accelerator.  While overall FRIB RF system availability is around 98%, the tetrode amplifier has been one of the leading causes of downtime (high voltage power supply issues, RF fingers, water leaks). The transition to solid-state technology is possible due to improvements in reliability and power density of solid- state transistors, and is necessary due to concerns of long term availability of vacuum tubes and the associated design expertise.  The cost of ownership is reduced by using the same 2 kW amplifier modules as the linac amplifiers, which allows sharing of spares and standardizes mainte- nance procedures. The modularity of SSA technology re- duces troubleshooting and repair time compared to the complex tetrode amplifier system. The transistors are bi- ased at 48V which eliminates the high-voltage power sup- plies and related issues. THE DESIGN The 120 kW solid-state amplifier system includes eight amplifier racks that can output 15 kW each into a matched load (Fig. 1). The design required an upgrade from four to six amplifier modules per rack, which required modifica- tions to the power distribution unit, driver-control unit (DCU), and N-way power combiner. This was all handled by the supplier. With the successful commissioning of two multi-rack, solid-state amplifier systems for the Multi-Harmonic Group Bunchers, and subsequent power upgrade to 30 kW, the FRIB RF group has gained the experience nec- essary to design and commission a solid-state 120 kW am- plifier system for the RFQ [2]. Figure 1: Amplifier rack system (TRUMPF HÃ¼ttinger GmbH + Co. KG). The amplifier system uses 3 dB quadrature hybrid cou- plers in a 3-stage cascaded corporate power combiner scheme. The first stage combiners (4 in total) each sum the output of two racks. The second stage combines the two outputs from the first stage, essentially combining four racks into one output. The third stage combines two four rack systems into one output to reach the desired goal of 120 kW (Fig. 2). ___________________________________________ * Work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science under Cooperative Agreement DE-SC0023633, the State of Michigan, and Michigan State University. â  gutierel@frib.msu.edu 16th International Conference on Heavy Ion Accelerator Technology,Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA JACoW Publishing ISBN: 978-3-95450-260-8 ISSN: 2673-5547 doi: 10.18429/JACoW-HIAT2025-TUP19 MC4: Accelerator Systems and Components 163 TUP: Tuesday Poster Session: TUP TUP19 Content from this work may be used under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 licence (Â© 2022).

The hybrid couplers have water-cooled loads on the iso- lation ports that are rated for the maximum output power in case phase settings are set incorrectly.  Typically, the power to the isolation loads is up to one-quarter of the max- imum output power for that stage (occurs if one input fails). Shown below is a 3-D rendering of the system (Fig. 3). Figure 3: Hybrid combiners. The water cooled loads are connected to an eight leg wa- ter manifold (Fig. 4). Seven of the legs are used continu- ously for the isolation loads and one branch is for the test load. Figure 4: Water manifold design. The amplifier system is driven by a Low Level RF (LLRF) controller through an 8-way splitter. Each output of the splitter has a 1 dB step attenuator (0.1 dB steps) to evenly balance the output power of each rack. The RF ca- bles are phase matched to make it easier to set the correct phase delay for the each amplifier rack, which is done us- ing internal phase shifters in the DCUs. The LLRF controller handles the run permit for the en- tire system. This run permit signal is in series through all of the driver-control units, so a fault in one of the racks will cause the entire system to interlock off. A Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is used to cal- orimetrically calculate the power being sent to the isolated loads. Interlock thresholds are set to trip if too much power is being dumped into any of the loads. The PLC also mon- itors water flow in the loads and supply pressure in the manifold. Additionally, the PLC can close automated water valves if a major leak is detected. TESTING RESULTS The racks were each individually tested into an RF short prior to combining the racks. At full reflection each rack system can only handle 12 kW. Several parameters are monitored including drain current, voltage and S11. Non- ionizing radiation surveys were conducted for personnel safety at this time. Figure 5 and Figure 6 show the results of single rack testing. All 8 racks were able to reach 12 kW of output power without any issues. Figure 5: Power Output rack 1 through 4. Figure 6: Power Output rack 5 through 8. To verify performance of each 4-rack sub-subsystem, the system was initially tested with the stage 1 and stage 2 power combiners only.

The attenuators were adjusted to get similar output power from each rack. Using a CS- Phoebus GUI, the phase delay settings were adjusted to maximize the combined output power. Figure 7 shows the results of this testing.  The output power was confirmed by comparing the sum of the rack power (measured by RF di- rectional couplers) to the calorimetric measurement of the test load. Figure 7: 40 kW testing results. Lastly, the overall system was connected to the Stage 3 power combiner. Figure 8 shows the results of the final testing up to 120 kW. In-rack power combining efficiency, accounting for circulator and internal power combiner losses, is greater than 88.5%. The combining efficiency of the three stages of external hybrid couplers is ~98%, result- ing in an overall efficiency of 86.7% at 120 kW output power. Figure 8: 120 kW testing results. CONCLUSION The 120 kW RFQ solid-state amplifier system is ready for commissioning with the RFQ during the FRIB 2025 summer maintenance shutdown. The existing tetrode am- plifier will be kept in place as a ready spare for up to one year, and then relocated to an offline RFQ test area.

Luo\nInstitute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou, China\nAbstract \nA ramping rate of 12 T/s is designed for the dipole mag-\nnet of BRing at HIAF. To reduce eddy current effects, a \ntitanium alloy lined chamber with a titanium alloy inner \nliner by 3D printing and an 0.3 mm ultra-thin stainless steel \nouter wall has been adopted. To reduce the internal pres-\nsure and enhance the beam lifetime, a film of TiZrV is \ncoated on the chamber.The ultimate vacuum of the titanium \nalloy-lined vacuum chamber is tested, which indicates that \nafter coating with TiZrV, the pressure at the middle of the \nchamber reduced, effectively reducing the pressure in the \ncentral region. The life of the TiZrV film was studied by \nrepeated venting and activation cycles under two condi-\ntions of N2 or air filling.

Among them, TiZrV \nfilm can be fully activated by vacuum baking at 180 â for \n24 hours, and the activation temperature meets the maxi-\nmum baking temperature allowed by the vacuum chamber \nmade of common accelerator materials [1, 2]. It is widely \nused in accelerator at home and abroad. The ramping rate \nof the dipole magnet of BRing in the new generation parti-\ncle accelerator named HIAF is 12 T/s [3].

This paper introduces the types of \npower supplies required for the FRIB which range in size \nfrom electrostatic high voltage power supplies less than \n1 Watt to 150 kW magnet power supplies. The power sup-\nplies range in complexity from simple single quadrant units \nto four-quadrant pulsed electrostatic high voltage units to \nunits requiring complex auxiliary equipment. Stability re-\nquirements of these power supplies range from 10 ppm for \nsome sensitive experimental equipment to 3000 ppm for \nsome multipole magnets.",
        "INTRODUCTION": "The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is a heavy \nion linear accelerator (linac) nuclear physics research facil-\nity with fast, stopped, and reaccelerated rare isotope beams. \nThe facility has been performing user experiments since \nMay, 2022 [1], prior to this, staged beam commissioning \nstarted in 2017 and continued until January 2022 [2].  \nIn total there are over 1500 power supplies (PS) in op-\nrations at FRIB. Based on experience from commissioning \nand the first years of operations, this paper consists of five \nsections describing (i) design principles, (ii) procurement \nstrategies, (iii) PS testing, (iv) availability, and (v) ongoing \ntasks.",
        "DESIGN PRINCIPLES": "The FRIB PS design is based on the flow down of func-\ntional requirements. To ensure high availability, while not \narbitrarily driving up costs, the FRIB requirements include \nthe flow down of field margin from Beam Physics, to Mag-\nnets, and finally to PS. This is important as adding margin \nto the current requirement for a magnet that is operating in \nsaturation could result in much lower magnetic field mar-\ngin. To further ensure high reliability, operational margin \nis added to the PS voltage and current for commercial off \nthe shelf (COTS) PS (minimum 10 % each for 5 year war-\nranty), or included in speciation for build to spec PS. \nTo ensure the best overall value for the magnet and PS \nsystems, the PS requirements were optimized with stake-\nholders from Accelerator Physics, Magnet Engineering, \nand PS Engineering. The number of different types of mag-\nnets and power supplies was minimized, allowing for com-\nmon spare parts, minimizing technical risk, labor risks, and \nlife-cycle",

        "PROCUREMENT STRATEGIES": "The procurement requirements were to obtain best value \nand on-time delivery of PS that fulfil the technical specifi-\ncations, while considering total cost of ownership by min-\nimizing life cycle costs.  \nThe general PS procurement strategy was to buy COTS",
        "PS TEST RESULTS": "The FRIB PS testing strategy was developed to eliminate \ntechnical risks as efficiently as possible. The strategy re-\nquired several rounds of testing: \nFirst article and pre-production factory acceptance test-\ning (FAT), rigorous test plans were developed to ensure that \nnot only the specifications were met, but also to validate \nthe component margin and thermal calculations. SCM PS \ndump resistors were verified to prove the temperature sim-\nulation was valid. Capacitor and IGBT temperatures were \nverified, ensuring high availability of those components. \nVoltage and current measurements of the AC/DC bulk PS, \nchopper resistor, and output filters verified the PS opera-\ntion was in-line with the simulation. Several issues were \nidentified during the first article and pre-production FAT \nwhich was an ideal time to mitigate those issues.  \n16th International Conference on Heavy Ion Accelerator Technology,Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA JACoW Publishing",
        "AVAILABILITY DATA": "Following standard availability calculations, the ex-\npected availability of over 1500 FRIB PS is ~99%. With \ndata from several years of commissioning and operations \nof FRIB PS, we see that FRIB modular PS availability has \nexceeded the calculations. Table 1 summarizes the availa-\nbility of the FRIB PS by fiscal year. During the first 4 years \nthe number of PS in operations grew exponentially during \nstaged commissioning. The transition to operations in 2022 \nand beyond shows the typical âbathtubâ curve with infant \nmortalities and software bugs explaining the higher num-\nber of PS incidents in 2022.  \nIt is difficult to pinpoint the reason that the higher avail-\nability has been achieved. Many aspects of the overall ap-\nproach to FRIB PS availability have been presented: The \ndesign principles included margin, optimization, and de-\nsign reviews. The FRIB approach to procurement led to \npartnering with successful suppliers. The tiered testing ap-\nproach mitigated technical risks.  \nTh",

We anticipate\nthat monitoring TM020 passband will be necessary to know\nwhich cell is ignited for future in-cryomodule processing,\nwhere we will be unable to see the plasma light though the\nviewports.

        "PLASMA CLEANING TRIAL": "We drew rings on 8 of the irises of a 5-cell cavity with\na permanent marker; irises being a region of high surface\nelectric field for the FM. We then attempted to remove the\nrings with an argon-oxygen plasma. If the oxygen reacts\nwith the hydrocarbons from the permanent marker, gaseous\nby-products such as CO, CO2, and H2O may be produced\nand pumped out of the cavity.\nAs shown in Fig. 5, we saw an increase in the partial pres-\nsures of these gases in the RGA signal after turning on the\nplasma. Almost all rings were removed after approximately\n10 hours of cleaning in each cell. As the TE111 is a dipole\npassband, the field distribution is not axisymmetric, given\nthat we drive only 1 polarization. However, as seen in Fig. 6,\nwe observe an azimuthally-symmetric removal of the rings,\nwhich indicates that the field distribution does not impair\nthe uniformity of cleaning.\nFigure 5: Selected RGA signals during plasma cleaning of\nCell 3.

We could\nignite plasma in each cell via the full FPC using the TE111\npassband with a maximum input power of 13 W. We mea-\nsured used parametric scans to find the drive power and\ndrive frequency shift to maximize the plasma density for\neach cell. Finally, we verified the plasma cleaning efficiency\nFigure 6: Photos of irises before and after plasma cleaning.\nThe permanent rings are visible before plasma cleaning (a,\nc) and are removed by the plasma (b, d).

        "HIGH RESOLUTION CURRENT CONTROL": "FROM SWITCHED MODE POWER SUPPLY* \nD. Novakâ , K. Bunnell, C. Dickerson, S. Klohe, S. Kumar, D. Santiago-Gonzalez, D. Stanton \nArgonne National Laboratory, Lemont IL, USA \nAbstract \nThe Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System \n(ATLAS) has been a National User Facility since 1985.  \nSince the commissioning of the Californium Rare Isotope \nBreeder Unit (CARIBU) in 2012, it has used 2 bespoke \nwater-cooled linear power supplies to allow for milliamp \ncontrol of the isobar separator magnets, which allows for \nmilligauss control of the magnets.  During the upgrade to \nnuCARIBU, the aging linear power supplies were replaced \nwith off-the-shelf (OTS) switched mode power supplies \n(SMPS).  The benefit of the SMPS is higher efficiency, \nlower cost, and since they are air-cooled, no load on the \nwater cooling infrastructure.  The limitation of the SMPS \nis a decrease in resolution in current control.  To overcome \nthis limitation, a device was constructed that allows control \nof a sub-milliamp con",
        "INTRODUCTION": "The CARIBU, Californium Rare Isotope Breeding Unit, \nfacility at Argonne ATLAS was commissioned in 2012, \nand has been providing low intensity, high purity, and \nneutron-rich beams for re-acceleration through ATLAS. \nDue to issues with the procurement of Californium, it was \ndecided to replace the Californium source and cask with a \ncompact proton cyclotron.  As a proton source, the \ncyclotron has the advantage of being a more reliable source \nof fission products, a higher overall fission rate, and easier \nto maintain and operate since it can be shut off [1].",
        "BACKGROUND": "CARIBU was designed with a compact high-resolution \nisobar separator [2, 3], which requires precise control of \nthe magnetic field.  This was previously achieved with a \npair of bespoke linear power supplies, which operated with \n6-digit current resolution, between 0 and 335 Amps in \nconstant-current mode. As these power supplies aged, they \nbegan to require more and more maintenance, until they \ngot to the point where they could no longer be controlled \nremotely.  The original manufacture had been sold, and the \nnew owner no longer supported the power supplies.  When \nit came time for the nuCARIBU upgrade, it was decided to \nreplace the power supplies for the isobar separator \nmagnets [4]. \nOff-the-shelf SMPS were deemed an acceptable \nreplacement for the bespoke supplies. SMPS power \nsupplies have a number of benefits when compared to \nlinear power supplies.  SMPS power supplies operate at a \nmuch higher efficiency, requiring only air cooling, where \nas the linear  supplies required ",
        "ISSUE": "The magnetic field produced must be controlled to \naccount for variations in the conditions of the CARIBU \nhall.  The largest single influence on the magnets, and thus \nthe field, is the water cooling system used by the magnets.  \nThe temperature of the cooling system water fluctuates, \nwhich affects the field.   To account for these changes, a \ncontrol loop is used within the control system to keep the \nfield strength as constant as possible.  As a result of the \nlimitations of the SMPS supply, the algorithm to control the \nmagnetic field had to be adjusted.  This was mainly due to \nthe current control resolution.  The SMPS power supply is \n ____________________________________________ \n*  This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office \nof Nuclear Physics, under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357.

        "SOLUTION": "To be able to precisely control the current going to the \nmagnet, and thus control the magnetic field, a method was \nneeded to bleed small amounts of current away from the \nmagnet.  A potentiometer of appropriated size was placed \nin parallel to the magnet and was tested in the arrangement \nas seen in Fig. 1.   \n \nFigure 1: Simplified model. \nTesting this arrangement proved that the concept was \nsound.  Current was bled through the potentiometer in a \nvery controllable manner.   \nIn the next step, the potentiometer was replaced with a \ndigital potentiometer which was control by a networked \nmicro-controller.  See Fig. 2.  This arrangement allowed \nthe digital potentiometer to be controlled remotely by the \ncontrol system.  The bleed circuit was tuned to be able to \nbleed around 5mA, which was chosen to coincide with the \npower supplies minimum steps size.  The effectively gives \n256 additional steps within the power supplies minimum \nstep, for a new minimum step size of about 19.5 nA. ",
        "FINDINGS": "With the hardware and the software in place, we were \nable to do A/B comparison testing with the two isobar \nseparator magnets in CARIBU.  This proved very \nadvantageous, as the two magnets are in close physical \nproximity and connected to the same cooling water system.  \nThis means that both magnets are seeing approximately the \nsame external influences, and thus make it easier to \nvalidate the effectiveness of the system in real time. \nIn Fig. 3 we see a comparison of the Gauss versus time \noutput of the 2 magnets over approximately 6.4 hours.  The \nline labeled â114â shows the Gauss value from magnet \nusing the device and running the gross control loop as well \nas the PID/fine control loop.  The line labeled â115â is the \nidentical magnet running only the gross control loop.  Both \nmagnets have a set-point of 3000.000 Gauss. \nInitial testing showed that when the fine control loop \nhanded control over to the gross control loop, there were \ntemporary jumps in the Gauss value.  See Fig",
        "CONCLUSIONS": "With the addition of the parallel circuit to bleed current \naway from the magnet, we were able to effectively take an \ninexpensive SMPS capable of approximately 5 mA of \nresolution, and give it approximately 19 nA resolution. \nThis allowed for our control algorithm to improve \nregulation from +/- 0.060 Gauss, to less than \n+/- 0.020 Gauss, with room for further improvement.  This \nhas allowed for the creation of a much more stable \nmagnetic field for the isobar separator than was previously \navailable. \nThis process could be applied to other loads that require \nsub-milliamp current control.",

        "INTRODUCTION": "The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) produces \nhigh intensity heavy ion beams of varied species and \ncharge states [1]. Measurement of the beam's quadrupole \nmoment is being investigated to characterize the transverse \nrms beam sizes and evaluate Courant Snyder parameters \nfor proper matching in critical sections in the linac. There \nare a number of interceptive methods to capture the quad-\nrupole moment, like wire scanners or viewers, but inter-\ncepting methods take a long time to evaluate the beam pa-\nrameters in the phase space. In addition, non-destructive \nmethods can be used during high-beam-power operations \nto assess beam envelopes in real time.   \nNon-destructive methods for estimating the quadrupole \nmoment of the transverse beam distribution have existed \nsince 1966 [2] using beam position monitors (BPMs), a \nstandard diagnostic device of which there are many placed \nall throughout the LINAC sections in the FRIB beamline \n[3]. However, the usual design of an electrosta",
        "UP DESIGN": "The magnetic quadrupole pick-up structure, shown in \nFig. 1, is designed with four wire loops at 45Â° angle to the \nhorizontal plane. These loops are placed just outside a ce-\nramic vacuum tube to interact with the beamâs magnetic \nfields while avoiding issues of the loops being vacuum \ncompatible or needing feedthroughs. The entire structure is \nplaced inside a pillbox cavity to maintain the continuation \nof wall currents through the structure. Additionally, the ra-\ndius of the pillbox should be at least twice that of the beam \npipe so that the conducting walls of the pillbox do not in-\nterfere with the magnetic flux through the wire loops. The \nwire loops are oriented as shown in Fig. 1 to couple only \nwith the radial component of the beamâs magnetic field. To \nsee this, the magnetic field of the beam is expressed in cy-\nlindrical coordinates as [5]: \nðµðµá¬â(ðð, ðð) = âð¼ð¼\nðð0\n2ððá\n1\nðð ððà· + ð¥ð¥Ì á\ncos ðð\nðð2 ððà· â\nsin ðð\nðð2 ððà·á+\nð¦ð¦à´¤á\nsin ðð\nðð2 ððà· +\ncos ðð\nðð2 ððà·á+ ððá\ncos 2ðð\nðð3\nððà· â",

        "MODELLING RESULTS": "Modelling was performed in CST [7], as shown in Fig. \n1. Here the structure was set to a longitudinal length of 50 \nmm, with a ceramic radius of 40.75 mm and an outer cavity \nradius of 95 mm, exceeding the requirement that the cavity \nradius be twice the radius of the ceramic. The lowest reso-\nnant frequencies of the outer cavity structure are 921 MHz \n[TM00] and 1324 MHz [TM01]. These are well above our \noperating frequency of 40.25 MHz, so they will not be an \nissue.  \nBeams themselves were modelled as 4 wires with a sig-\nnal travelling in-phase down the wires. The beams were \nmodelled in this fashion because any future test-stand \nmeasurements would be performed with a four wire con-\nfiguration.  \nBeam currents less than 650 eÎ¼A (the eventual current of",

        "USA": "Abstract \nAt FRIB, a chopper in the low energy beamline is used \nfor beam duty factor control as well as beam mitigation for \nmachine protection.

        "INTRODUCTION": "The FRIB linac has a chopper in its low-energy beam \ntransport [1] to generate a pulse structure in the heavy ion \nbeam by deflecting a temporal portion of it with a trans-\nverse electric field. The deflected beam is intercepted with \na downstream beam absorber. The chopper is used to 1) \ngenerate a regular notch (beam-off period) for beam diag-\nnostics systems, 2) generate pulsed beams for beam tuning, \nand 3) mitigate the beam at an interlocked event for ma-\nchine protection. \nThe chopper system has two deflecting plates to which \nthe high voltage (HV) is applied by HV power supplies \nthrough HV switches. The FRIB Global Timing System \n(GTS) provides a beam pulse structure signal to the chop-\nper monitor. The chopper monitor receives feedback sig-\nnals from the HV switches representing the connected volt-\nage level and the outgoing/incoming electric charge flow \nrate (current) (see Fig. 1). \nThe GTS signal, voltage levels, and outgoing/incoming \ncharge flows are all compared to their",

Heavy ion \nbeams have served as essential tools for advancing our un-\nderstanding of nuclear structure, synthesizing over a thou-\nsand new isotopes, and discovering dozens of new ele-\nments.

        "TH GENERATION ECR ION SOURCE": "In the development of (ECR) ion sources, the frequency-\nscaling principle remains applicable. To develop high-per-\nformance ECR ion sources that outperform the current \nstate-of-the-art high-charge-state machines, the develop-\nment of next-generation machines is imperative. 3rd gener-\nation ECR ion sources typically operate at frequencies \nranging from 18 to 28 GHz. Consequently, the 4th genera-\ntion ECR ion sources are anticipated to operate at frequen-\ncies approximately twice that of the existing ones, specifi-\ncally in the range of 40 to 56 GHz. Correspondingly, the \npeak magnetic fields inside the plasma chamber should \nreach as high as Binj>5.0 T and Br>2.8 T. These field \nstrengths are unattainable with the conventional magnets \nused in 3rd generation ECR ion sources.

Toddâ , J.Y. Benitez, N. Brickner, P. Coleman, N. Intwala, S. Small, D. Thatcher Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA Abstract Elements 115-118 were discovered by bombarding transuranic targets with high-current 48Ca beams, but a lack of heavier targets prevents extending the periodic table us- ing these beams.  The recent production of two atoms of element 116 by LBNL researchers using 50Ti opens a new pathway for the discovery of elements beyond 118.  The 88-Inch Cyclotronâs acceleration and delivery of the puA 50Ti beams used to create these two particles are discussed. In particular, we present the novel inductive oven used to provide a stable stream of 50Ti vapor to LBNLâs supercon- ducting electron cyclotron resonance ion source Venus, ex- tract >100 ÂµA Ti12+, and minimize consumption of this ex- pensive, low-abundance isotope. INTRODUCTION Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) has a long history of involvement in the discovery of radioactive elements, having been directly involved in or been the site of the discovery of 15 such elements (and one stable ele- ment).  The last element discovered at LBNL, seaborgium (element 106), was produced by bombarding a californium target with oxygen beams [1].  Since that time, a further twelve elements have been discovered at other laboratories around the world. With its upcoming search for element 120, LBNL will once again try to expand the periodic table using a californium target, this time using 50Ti projectile beams. The six most recent element discoveries, elements 113-118, were the result of experiments with 48Ca beams incident upon actinide targets of increasing atomic number from 94 to 98 (Pu to Cf).  A lack of sufficient material for targets with atomic number greater than 98 prevents this successful projectile from extending the periodic table fur- ther.  However, a potential way to continue in the same vein is to use projectile beams with higher atomic number. The production of element 120 using 50Ti projectile beams will require beam energies in the 5-6 MeV/u range to surpass the Coulomb barrier, and high currents (~pÂµA) for reasonable production rates of multiple-per-year of beam time.  As a demonstration that 50Ti beams can be used for superheavy (atomic number > 103) element produc- tion, high-current beams were developed by the Operations and Ion Source teams at LBNLâs 88-Inch Cyclotron and used to bombard a 244Pu target to produce element 116 (Lv) particles [2].  This result represents the first time that su- perheavy elements have been produced using titanium ion beams and paves the way for the upcoming element 120 search. Based on predicted element 120 cross-sections, the 88-Inch Cyclotron staff has been charged with producing 50Ti12+ beam currents in excess of 1 pÂµA to superheavy el- ement experiments continually for multiple runs of ten- day-length.  Additionally, as 50Ti is a low-abundance, ex- pensive isotope, we are tasked with producing these beams while maintaining a material consumption rate less than 5 mg/hour.  In the following two sections we describe what this means for both the cyclotron and the source providing it beam.  The difficulties titanium presents in the source are discussed and the novel inductive oven we have designed and used to demonstrate 50Tiâs viability in superheavy re- search is presented in the subsequent section.  The two final sections give results using this oven and discuss further op- timizations to be made to improve performance. ACCELERATOR LBNLâs 88-Inch Cyclotron is a flexible, K140 cyclotron originally designed as a light ion accelerator.  However, with the addition of increasingly advanced electron cyclo- tron resonance (ECR) ion sources, this cyclotron has accel- erated over half of the naturally occurring elements.  The acceleration frequencies of the cyclotronâs single dee are between 5.6 and 16.5 MHz with a maximum dee voltage of approximately 70 kV.  In recent years, the majority of this cyclotronâs accelerated beams have been used for two purposes: single event space effects testing and superheavy element research.  For the former, low-current beams (typ- ically 10s of pA to 10s of nA) with energies between 5 and 20 MeV/u and masses across the periodic table are deliv- ered to experimenters to test radiation effects on space- bound equipment.  For the latter, high-current, moderate mass beams (up to a couple pÂµA with atomic mass in the 40-50 amu range) are delivered to heavy targets with ener- gies in the 5-6 MeV/u range. For the cyclotron, the production of high-current 50Ti beams is an extension of well more than two decadesâ ex- perience accelerating high-current beams for superheavy element production.  After the completion of transmission improvements and the addition of a spiral inflector, the 88-Inch Cyclotron has demonstrated its ability to acceler- ate and deliver over 2 pÂµA 48Ca11+ beams to superheavy el- ement researchers [3].  The accelerated species for the tita- nium beams is 50Ti12+, and since its mass-to-charge ratio is similar to the successful experiments with 48Ca, transport through the injection line and spiral inflector is possible without any modifications.  There is no reason to not ex- pect similar cyclotron performance for titanium beams as was found for calcium, provided the ion source can pro- duce the required beam currents.

The magnetic structure for VENUS is a sextupole made up of NbTi racetrack coils nestled inside three NbTi solenoid coils [4].  The combination of these coils produces a âminimum-Bâ configuration where the magnetic field magnitude is a minimum at the source cen- ter and increases in all directions.  Two injected microwave frequencies, 28 and 18 GHz, are used to resonantly ener- gize electrons on closed surfaces of constant magnetic fields about that minimum, and the resulting confined, en- ergetic electrons ionize neutrals and ions to produce the highly-charged ions needed by the cyclotron.  The micro- waves for VENUS are produced by a gyrotron that can de- liver up to 10 kW of 28 GHz power and two 18 GHz klys- trons that can deliver 2 kW each. It is generally easiest to produce high-current ion beams if that material can be delivered to the source plasma as a gas.  For high-current beams from materials like calcium and titanium which are solid at room temperature, we typ- ically use ovens to heat them to the point they outgas sig- nificantly and direct this gas toward the plasma.  This aim- ing of ejected gas toward the plasma is extremely important for many of the beam materials used for superheavy ele- ment research.  Superheavy elements typically have neu- tron numbers more than 50% greater than their proton numbers, so both the targets and incoming beams need to be neutron rich.  The neutron-rich isotopes used, such as 48Ca and 50Ti, are low-abundance and are therefore expen- sive.  Any material injected into the source that is not cap- tured by the plasma is lost to any âcoldâ surface it encoun- ters, so to improve efficiency it is best to aim the injected material at the plasma center (the center of the source) where the plasma density is highest and therefore there is the greatest chance of that material ionizing and being ex- tracted as beam.  Additionally, net cross-field diffusion is outward from the source center for ions, so starting ions as near the axis as possible improves the likelihood of these ions being converted to beam. Because 50Ti is both expensive and rare, the ion source group was tasked with producing the needed 60-100 ÂµA of 50Ti12+ beam to deliver >1 pÂµA to the target (assuming typ- ical 10-20% transmission through the cyclotron) while consuming 5 mg or less per hour of 50Ti. OVENS Both high- and low-temperature ovens have been suc- cessfully used with the VENUS ion source [5, 6].  The low- temperature ovens used for calcium beam production have performed particularly well, producing beams on target with currents up to 2 pÂµA while consuming 48Ca at a rate of approximately 0.5 mg/hour.  The key characteristic making this oven so efficient is the set of 10 8.5-mm-long channels with diameters of either 0.97 or 1.09 mm that di- rect the 48Ca gas toward the plasma center.  It is essential that these channels stay as hot or hotter than the crucible holding the material to prevent condensation and clogging. Maintaining this higher temperature is possible for the low- temperature oven (maximum temperature ~700Â°C), as it relies on conduction for temperature equilibration and the body temperatures are low enough that radiative losses arenât a major issue.  Titaniumâs required temperatures of approximately 1600Â°C to outgas significantly prevent its use in this otherwise highly-effective oven. The crucibles for the resistive, high-temperature ovens historically used in VENUS are constructed thin-walled conductors that can reach temperatures over 2000Â°C. However, these ovens are susceptible to damage from strong Lorentz forces during operation as these currents are nearly perpendicular to the VENUSâ local 3-4 tesla mag- netic fields.  Additionally, at high operating temperatures the oven material is susceptible to damage from (often poorly understood) chemical reactions between the cruci- ble and the desired beam material and/or its gas. Rather than focusing on the chemistry difficulties, we decided to produce an inductive oven to get the material to temperature.  Inductive ovens have been successfully used in high-field ECR ion sources at IMP in China and at FRIB in the United States [7, 8].  Both laboratories utilize a de- sign where a cylindrical susceptor (the inductively-heated crucible) has its symmetry axis parallel to the long axis of the source, and material is ejected through a hole in one end.  The fact that these ovens are typically required to be positioned centimeters off of the source axis, means that much of the material ejected from the oven will not pass through the heart of the source plasma and efficiency will be lower than might be possible with better aiming.  Add- ing any sort of a channel at the exit end is made difficult as the inductive coilâs highest magnetic field (and therefore highest temperature of the coaxial susceptor) is near the center of the inductive coil.  Any channel in a region with lower inductive flux is susceptible to clogging if its tem- perature is lower than the material location, and radiative cooling of any channels at the end of the oven must be con- sidered as it isnât easily thermally shielded. To get around these difficulties, we have designed a novel inductive oven with its coil perpendicular to the long axis of the source [9].  The axis of the cylindrical susceptor is vertical (Fig. 1), allowing for a rotation of the susceptor opening about that symmetry axis toward the plasma to better deliver outgassed material into the source plasma. Additionally, this configuration allows for the use of the oven with materials that melt before sublimating. In order to make the oven quickly serviceable, the oven assembly and the ~1.1-meter-long shaft it is attached to has been designed to fit through a 37.1-mm-diameter port.  The hollow annealed copper coil (OD: 3.97 mm, wall thick- ness: 0.36 mm) has five turns and is typically operated at approximately 175 kHz heating frequency, requiring ~800- 1000 W of operational power for titanium production. The yttria-stabilized zirconia insulator body is nested within the coil with an outside diameter of 21.6 mm, wall thickness of 3 mm, and height of 27 mm.  The coils have been designed so that a thin zirconia rod is supported by the coils and which supports the oven assembly (Fig. 1). This is perhaps the weakest aspect of the design, but the rods have not failed in any serious way while in use. The molybdenum susceptor (OD: 12.7 mm, wall thick- ness: 1.2 mm) is 17.3 mm tall and has a material exit aper- ture machined approximately halfway up the side by sweeping a 2-mm-diameter hole perpendicular to the cyl- inder axis 1.9 mm. 16th International Conference on Heavy Ion Accelerator Technology,Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA JACoW Publishing ISBN: 978-3-95450-260-8 ISSN: 2673-5547 doi: 10.18429/JACoW-HIAT2025-WEY02 200 MC7: Ion Sources, Traps, and Charge Breeding WEY02 WEY: Invited Talks: WEY Content from this work may be used under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 licence (Â© 2022).

To minimize thermal conduction between the insulator and the susceptor, angled and split molybdenum rings were constructed to maintain ~1 mm spacing between the sus- ceptor and the insulator while minimize contact area be- tween the ring and each. Figure 1: Cross-section of the inductive oven.  A five-turn inductive coil surrounds a 3-mm-thick yttria-stabilized zir- conia insulator (white) which is supported by an insulator from the same material held in place by the coils. The mo- lybdenum susceptor is supported within the insulator by a pair of angled molybdenum rings that minimize thermal contact between susceptor and insulator. RESULTS As we were under time constraints to produce 50Ti beams, the inductive oven only had one natural titanium test run in VENUS before being put into service with 50Ti beams.  As of this writing this oven has performed excep- tionally well and played a central role in the first ever pro- duction of element 116 with titanium beams.  The oven has been used for over ten weeks of cyclotron beam production in ten day intervals.  During that time, the source would effortlessly produce ~100 ÂµA 50Ti12+ beams and was able to produce over 200 ÂµA, though this is much more than the cyclotron can accelerate.  Beam currents delivered to ex- periments were between 1 and 2 pÂµA, as can be seen in Fig. 2. Consumption rates for experimental runs have been found to be between 2.5 and 4.5 mg/hour, and are largely dependent on the care taken when tuning the source (it is often possible, and tempting, to produce more beam by in- creasing the oven output rather than source optimization). To date, as the oven and source have produced sufficient beam, little time has been spent exploring the operation space.  As a case in point, the oven has only been run using relatively low microwave heating power (~600-1000 W of 18 GHz) and only at magnetic fields necessary for 18 GHz operation. It should be noted that though Fig. 2 shows long term beam variation, the source is quite stable for short term variations.  The instabilities that plagued other titanium production attempts due to titanium acting as a getter ma- terial and affecting source pressure have not been an issue with this oven.  With more time and effort, we are confident we could reduce the long-term variations in beam current. It should be noted that a characteristic of these beams that we donât run into as much with our non-metal beams is the frequent (hourly at a minimum) need to provide minor ad- justments to the analysing dipole immediately after the source when sending these titanium beams through the cy- clotron.  We have also seen considerably higher (50-100% higher) total extracted beam currents when running tita- nium and for an extended period after.  This will be ad- dressed in later work. Figure 2: 50Ti12+ beam current (circles) measured by induc- tive pickup immediately upstream of the superheavy ele- ment experiment for a recent ten-day-run, with 1 pÂµA in- dicated with the horizontal dotted line.  Note that slow var- iations in beam current are not important for these experi- ments, so experimenters would often prefer a slow varia- tion of current rather than interruptions for tuning. The drops in current below 1 pÂµA are typically for cyclotron tuning, cyclotron RF clamps, Faraday cup insertion, etc. FURTHER OPTIMIZATION The greatest hindrance to oven optimization is availabil- ity of the VENUS ion source.  The ovens can be tested of- fline to ensure they donât clog, for example, but optimizing consumption rates requires the ovens be installed and op- erated in VENUS: a source that is in high demand and in near-continuous use. Additionally, there is a bit of recovery time needed after titanium (like many metals) has been used in the source, so testing titanium between cyclotron runs is not ideal. Making things more difficult, to accu- rately measure consumption rate (the primary number we are trying to optimize), we need the source to run at least a day with each configuration and it needs to be pulled and weighed between configuration changes, so this work is extremely time consuming and we have a limited schedule. To date we have not made any changes to the ovenâs lo- cation relative to the plasma (closer or further), and we ha- venât taken great care in accurately setting its rotation an- gle.  It is expected that both of these parameters could be optimized to improve material consumption rates. Initial testing of the addition of aiming channels has taken place.  We have added channels to a cylindrical oven (Fig. 3) and to an elongated design, and for both cases, when inductively heated, the temperatures of the channels have been found to be greater than the remainder of the visible susceptor through the insulator aperture (Fig. 4)âa necessary condition to prevent clogging.

However, it is important to note that the oven was run continuously for multiple days without clogging.  The alignment optimization that has not yet taken place for the oven above is much more critical when using a channelled susceptor that emits a more directed output gas, and will be crucial moving forward.  Further measurements will be performed with a more dedicated effort to align the barrels and maintain that alignment upon insertion. Figure 3: Cross-sectional view (left) of the cylindrical sus- ceptor of same overall dimensions as the primary oven but with aiming channels added.  The actual molybdenum sus- ceptor is shown at right. Figure 4: Thermal imaging of the channel holes of an elon- gated susceptor design looking through the aperture of the surrounding insulator, where lighter colors indicate higher temperatures.  The circular holes can be seen to be hotter than the surrounding susceptor, making them less likely to clog from material condensation. These alignment issues illustrate the shortcomings of a cylindrically symmetric barrel design: the fact that it is eas- ily rotated about its axis and difficult to align.  As men- tioned, we have tested an elongated design that breaks ro- tational symmetry, but the initial design was too long and radiation losses prevented it from reaching outgassing tem- peratures (note that as temperatures approach 1780Â°C, the susceptor will radiate heat away at e W/mm2, where e is the blackbody emissivity).  This susceptor was tested with sil- ver and it produced hundreds of microamp beams, but optimized consumption rates were not possible as the 28 GHz microwaves raised the temperature of the oven higher than desired (the inductive supply wasnât even turned on and the oven was heated by microwaves). As mentioned above, running the titanium beams using a combination of 28 and 18 GHz power should and will be explored, and it is highly likely that this combination will lead to operation modes that provide better consumption than those found using 18 GHz only.

During that time, the source would \neffortlessly produce ~100 ÂµA 50Ti12+ beams and was able \nto produce over 200 ÂµA, though this is much more than the \ncyclotron can accelerate.  Beam currents delivered to ex-\nperiments were between 1 and 2 pÂµA, as can be seen in \nFig. 2. \nConsumption rates for experimental runs have been \nfound to be between 2.5 and 4.5 mg/hour, and are largely \ndependent on the care taken when tuning the source (it is \noften possible, and tempting, to produce more beam by in-\ncreasing the oven output rather than source optimization).  \nTo date, a",
        "FURTHER OPTIMIZATION": "The greatest hindrance to oven optimization is availabil-\nity of the VENUS ion source.  The ovens can be tested of-\nfline to ensure they donât clog, for example, but optimizing \nconsumption rates requires the ovens be installed and op-\nerated in VENUS: a source that is in high demand and in \nnear-continuous use. Additionally, there is a bit of recovery \ntime needed after titanium (like many metals) has been \nused in the source, so testing titanium between cyclotron \nruns is not ideal. Making things more difficult, to accu-\nrately measure consumption rate (the primary number we \nare trying to optimize), we need the source to run at least a \nday with each configuration and it needs to be pulled and \nweighed between configuration changes, so this work is \nextremely time consuming and we have a limited schedule. \nTo date we have not made any changes to the ovenâs lo-\ncation relative to the plasma (closer or further), and we ha-\nvenât taken great care in accurately setting its rotation an-\n"

        "USA": "Abstract\nThe extraction system of the 88-Inch Cyclotron at\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has been modified\nto enable single-bunch extraction. This is achieved by in-\ncreasing the voltage of the first deflector to oversteer the\nbeam, halting extraction, and then selectively switching it\noff using a high-voltage chopper to synchronize the deflec-\ntorâs operational voltage with the transit time of a single\nbunch, enabling its extraction. A pre-chopper positioned\nbefore the cyclotron limits the beam available for acceler-\nation, minimizing activation and sputtering damage from\ndiscarded bunches. This cost-effective technique is crucial\nfor time-sensitive experiments and provides precise control\nover dose delivery, broadening the cyclotronâs range of ap-\nplications. Future efforts will focus on increasing extraction\nfrequency by optimizing the deflector electronics for faster\nrecovery times, and exploring sequential switching of two\ndeflectors to reduce the required oversteering vol",
        "INTRODUCTION": "Recent developments in pulsed power technology have\nled to significant enhancements in beam chopping systems\nfor particle accelerators. High-voltage switching units com-\nposed of series and parallel arrays of modern semiconduc-\ntors, such as MOSFETs, IGBTs, and SCRs, can now deliver\nfast switching performance with low jitter and high effi-\nciency. These systems are capable of managing hundreds of\nkilovolts and tens of kiloamperes within sub-microsecond\ntimescales, enabling precise temporal control of particle\nbeams for high-resolution applications across various accel-\nerator facilities [1,2].\nTandem beam chopper systems are typically categorized\nas either fast and slow choppers or as pre-chopper and main\nchopper [3,4]. In the first configuration, fast choppers are\nused in applications requiring nanosecond-scale resolution,\nsuch as precise bunch selection and timing control, while\nslow choppers serve broader intensity modulation purposes.\nIn the latter configuration, the pre-chopper is",

        "HARDWARE": "The pre-chopper system at the 88-Inch Cyclotron uses\ncommercially available high-voltage MOSFET pulsers\n(Behlke FSWP 51-02 [7]) to control beam injection. Po-\nsitioned before the beam enters the cyclotron, it applies up\nto Â±2 kV across electrostatic plates to steer the beam away\nfrom the inflector, effectively blocking injection. When the\nvoltage is removed, the beam continues to the inflector and\nenters the RF acceleration process.\nFor safe and reliable operation, the pre-chopper is liquid-\ncooled with Galden HT135 PFPE fluid and includes an\ninterlock that shuts it down if temperatures exceed 75Â°C.\nThe system also incorporates ceramic capacitors for volt-\nage buffering and series resistors to protect the pulsers from\nvoltage reflections due to impedance mismatches.\nThe chopper system hardware at the 88-Inch Cyclotron\nshown in Fig. 3 [8]. It utilizes a fast high-voltage SCR switch\n(Behlke HTS 800-100-SCR [7]) integrated into the first elec-\ntrostatic deflector to achieve single-bunch e",
        "EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS": "The 88-Inch Cyclotron at LBNL was configured to ac-\ncelerate 16 MeV deuteron beams using a first harmonic RF\nat 6.3 MHz. To reduce activation and sputtering from high\nbeam power, the pre-chopper limited the beam duty cycle to\n10â5, delivering 10 Âµs pulses every second.\nFigure 4 illustrates the effectiveness of the chopped deflec-\ntor system used for beam selection at the 88-Inch Cyclotron.\nThe x-axis represents time in microseconds. The left y-axis\ndisplays current from a FCT diagnostic, Bergoz Instrumenta-\ntion model FCT-082-05:1-H [9], located after the deflectors.\nThe right y-axis shows the chopper voltage signal.\nThe top trace in blue shows the pre-chopped beam, which\nconsists of a continuous train of bunches selected by the\npre-chopper without activating the chopper. The red trace\nbeneath it represents the extracted beam after the chopper is\nturned on: several bunches are allowed through initially, and\nonce the deflector is switched off, subsequent bunches are\nsuppressed.

Redaelli\nEuropean Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), Geneva, Switzerland\nM. Seidel, Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), Villigen, Switzerland\n1also at Ãcole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland\nAbstract\nMeasurements of the transverse beam halo in the LHC\nshowed that it contains a non-negligible portion of the total\nstored beam energy, with potential implications for collima-\ntion system performance, machine availability and overall\nmachine protection. In the HL-LHC era, when a significant\nincrease in stored beam energy is planned, the understand-\ning and modelling of the beam halo distribution becomes\neven more important. This applies particularly for the risk\nquantification in view of new failure scenarios not present\nin the LHC, like fast failures of the new crab-cavities or of\nthe quench protection system of new triplet magnets. This\ncontribution summarizes the recent progress in beam halo\nmeasurement,",
        "INTRODUCTION": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is a syn-\nchrotron designed to accelerate and collide two beams of\nprotons or heavy ions. Its original design specified a max-\nimum stored energy of 362 MJ per beam at 7 TeV, with in-\ntensities of 1.15 Ã 1011 particles per bunch (ppb) [1]. This\nvalue was exceeded during the current operational Run 3,\nwith stored energies reaching up to 430 MJ. Following the\nplanned Long Shutdown 3 (LS3), the LHC will be upgraded\nto the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), where stored ener-\ngies are expected to reach 680 MJ with 2.2 Ã 1011 ppb [2].\nEven small particle losses from such high-intensity beams\ncan trigger quenches in the superconducting magnets, reduc-\ning operational efficiency. In worst case scenarios, uncon-\ntrolled beam losses could even induce damage to accelerator\nhardware components. To mitigate these risks, the LHC em-\nploys a sophisticated multi-stage collimation system, which\nwill undergo major upgrades to prepare for the HL-LHC\nera [3]. The collim",
        "METHOD OF HALO MEASUREMENT": "Collimator Scraping\nThe primary collimators in the LHC consist of two mov-\nable jaws positioned symmetrically around the circulating\nbeam, at an amplitude of 5 ðLHC at the top energy of 6.8 TeV\nin Run 3. These jaws can be independently moved toward\nthe beam core in increments as small as 5 Âµm, thereby re-\nducing the effective betatron cut. In IR 7, three primary\ncollimators are installed per beam, enabling halo scraping in\n16th International Conference on Heavy Ion Accelerator Technology,Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA JACoW Publishing",

        "BEAM HALO MODELS": "Generalised Gaussian Models\nThe characterisation of the analytical form of the trans-\nverse beam halo has been the focus of extensive research\nefforts, with Gaussian (G), q-Gaussian (qG), and double-\nGaussian (dG) distributions being among the most frequently\nemployed models [8,9]. Let us model collimator scraping\nin normalised transverse phase space, defined by coordi-\nnates (ð,ðâ²), where ð= {ð,ð}. The generalized particle\namplitude in this space is expressed as ð=\nâ\nð2 + ðâ²2. Con-\nsequently, halo profiles derived from collimator scrapings\nare naturally represented in radial space, incorporating both\ncanonical variables. Standard analytical distributions are\ntypically defined in projection space, with their probability\ndensity functions depending solely on a single normalized\ncoordinate ð.\nTo compare scraping-derived halo profiles to analytical\nmodels, it is imperative that both be expressed within a com-\nmon coordinate frameworkâeither in projection space or\nradial space. Although th",
        "HALO DEPLETION STUDIES": "HEL Concept Overview\nVarious halo control and depletion techniques have been\nexplored over the years [23].

A moderate reduction in efficiency is\nobserved under more relaxed collimation settings currently\nunder consideration for Run 4. Further on, a difference\nbetween the HEL depletion efficiency is observed based\non initial halo distribution. Future work will investigate\nalternative active halo control methods to meet HL-LHC\nperformance and protection goals. Concurrently, updated\nhalo models will be integrated into failure scenario simula-\ntions â such as quench protection heater and crab cavity\nmalfunctions â and depletion strategies will be validated\nvia tracking simulations and, where possible, experimental\nbeam measurements.",

        "BEAM WIRE COMPENSATORS": "FOR THE HL-LHC ERA\nP. BÃ©langerâ,1, R. Baartman, D. Kaltchev, TRIUMF, Vancouver, Canada\nG. Sterbini, CERN, Geneva, Switzerland\n1 also at University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada\nAbstract\nBeam-beam long-range interactions are known to be a\nstrong source of non-linearities in hadron colliders, under-\nmining the performance of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\nduring proton-proton collisions. In order to enhance the\nluminosity production of the machine and increase the toler-\nance of the working point after the High Luminosity upgrade\nof the LHC (HL-LHC), dedicated correctors such as beam-\nbeam wire compensators can be used. In this paper, the\nbeam dynamics of this compensation problem is studied in\ndetails, ultimately showing that the linearity of the machine\ncan be significantly improved throughout the beam core â\nand up to several sigmas â leading to an improvement of the\ndynamic aperture. This conclusion is shown to be supported\nby analytic calculations, simulation studies, as w",
        "INTRODUCTION": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is soon to be upgraded\ninto the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) which is planned\nto be operational by 2030. For this new era, the focus will\nbe to increase the luminosity production of the machine\nby pushing the operational scenarios into increasingly\nchallenging regimes. As such, controlling the non-linearities\nof the lattice and improving the beam lifetime is critical to\nreach the target of the HL-LHC project. Alongside electron\nclouds, the main source of non-linearities in the LHC is the\nbeam-beam (BB) effect, arising from the electromagnetic\ninteraction between the two counter-rotating beams. In the\ninteraction regions (IRs), the two beams share a common\nbeam pipe and perturb one another.\nHead-On (HO)\ncollisions take place at the interaction points (IPs), whereas\nLong-Range (LR) interactions are distributed on both sides\nof the IPs. These interactions, akin to strong multipolar\nerrors, occur several times (â50) per IR for the nominal\nbunches and contrib",

On the experimental front, successful\nbeam-beam compensation was recently demonstrated\nin the LHC during dedicated machine development\nexperiments [8, 9] as well as regular LHC operation [9].\nHowever, the integration of a full-scale compensation\nsystem in the machine for the HL-LHC era â the first\nof its kind â requires additional considerations to op-\ntimize the effects on the beam dynamics, as discussed below.\nIn this paper, the linearity of the IRs is studied with and\nwithout BBWCs at various amplitudes using the non-linear\nresidual, which will be introduced.

Using this setup, \nwe studied field-dependent BCS and residual resistances in \nthe single-cell FRIB400 R&D cavity, which experienced \n800Â°C 2N0 doping followed by 5 um post EP, and we ex-\namined their behavior at two different frequencies: \n644 MHz FM and 1.45 GHz HOM.  \nThe 1.45 GHz HOM 2K Q-curve exhibits an anti-Q \nslope, while the 644 MHz FM does not. Decomposition \ninto RBCS and R0 showed that the difference in Q-slope with \nresonant frequency was due to field-dependent RBCS in the \nN-doped cavity. Analysis of R0 showed agreement with \npast research regarding frequency dependence of R0 sensi-\ntivity to trapped magnetic flux and its dependence on RF \nfields. The RBCS behavior is of particular interest, and fu-\nture study is needed to further optimize the cavity surface \ntreatment for reducing the Q-slope even further, and possi-\nbly for producing an anti-Q slope in sub-GHz resonant fre-",

Lokeyâ , Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA\nAbstract\nWork continues on a minimally invasive, nitrogen fluo-\nrescence gas sheet at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams\n(FRIB). A low density gas sheet may be used to observe\nthe 2D transverse beam profile of high intensity, multiple\ncharge state beams with minimal interference. Spatially and\ntemporally correlated profiles are of particular interest in\nlocations where there is significant charge state spread, such\nas the FRIB linac folding segments. A low-density gas sheet\nmeasurement system offers advantages for gas handling in\nnitrogen sensitive areas, however signal intensity is signifi-\ncantly lower than techniques using higher density gas sheets\nand jets. This work discusses measurement considerations\nfor photon distributions generated by several spatially sep-\narated interaction points and design considerations for a\nhigh-sensitivity optics sy",
        "INTRODUCTION": "Beam induced fluorescence (BIF) monitors are currently\nin use and under development at several facilities and offer a\nminimally interfering method to monitor the 2D transverse\nbeam profile [1,2]. In BIF devices, the beam excites a work-\ning gas which then emits photons during a de-excitation\nprocess. The gas can be shaped and positioned so that the\nresulting data collected correlates to the transverse beam\nprofile.\nMinimally interfering monitors are useful for high inten-\nsity beams, where component degradation with devices that\nintercept the beam become a concern. For example, the Fa-\ncility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) linac produces heavy\nion beams of various species that can be selected to have\nmultiple charge states. The linac consists of three folding\nsections with 60 degree bends. Achromatic optics are used\nto steer the beam through the turns, which causes spread in\nthe charge states as it passes [3]. A 2D simultaneous profile\nin this area could give helpful insight to operator",
        "OPTICS AND ELECTRONICS\nCONSIDERATIONS": "Fluorescence Process\nThe fluorescence cross section is proportional to the dif-\nferential energy loss of the interaction and square of the\ncharge state of the ion. This is advantageous for high charge\nstate ions, as the photon production will be higher. During\ncollision, the working gas undergoes both ionization and ex-\ncitation, the former of which creates singly charged ions and\nsecondary electrons. Neutral atoms are also excited by these\nsecondary electrons, and both species de-excite releasing\noptical photons [5].\nPhoton Capture\nTotal photon yield is proportional to the gas pressure, the\nnumber of particles in a bunch, and the ion charge. Due\nto the low density of the gas molecules in the system, low\nfluorescence cross section even for favorable working gases,\nand a small solid angle of detection, the signal of the monitor\nis expected to be low.\n16th International Conference on Heavy Ion Accelerator Technology,Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA JACoW Publishing",

        "MECHANICAL DESIGN": "Gas Sheet Generator\nDesign work is completed on the mechanical portion of\nthe system. The device creates a gas sheet by leaking gas into\na thin slit with large length and width dimensions compared\nto its depth. This gives the molecules a large mean free\npath, reducing intermolecular collisions in the generator and\ntherefore narrowing the gas density distribution across the\ngas sheet [2]. The sheet is further collimated to remove\nmolecules emitted at off-angles, reducing the divergence of\nthe sheet as it passes through the interaction chamber.\nFigure 4 shows a close up view of the gas sheet generating\nsection. The width and length of the slit are 100 mm, with a\nchannel depth of 0.1 mm, increasing to 0.3 mm at the nozzle\nexit and collimating slit to achieve the desired thickness.\nThe generator is placed on a rotatable cradle, allowing for\nthe angle of the gas sheet to be adjusted for calibration or\nreoriented for density measurement tests. The distance of\nthe slit from the collimator is ",
        "CONCLUSION": "Using a low-density gas sheet offers advantages for gas\nhandling in nitrogen sensitive areas, however signal intensity\nand long integration time is a significant concern for use with\nreal-time monitoring. Work continues on an application of\nimage processing techniques to help determine the theoreti-\ncal light output, optical transforms, and error estimation for\nthe designed system.",

        "USA": "Abstract \nThis work presents an overview of beam loss detection \nand mitigation at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams \n(FRIB). A diverse array of loss monitoring systemsâin-\ncluding ion chambers, neutron detectors, halo rings, fast \nthermometry, and differential beam current monitors \n(BCM)âare deployed to detect losses ranging from large \nevents that risk machine damage to low-level losses that \nresult in undesirable machine activation. To ensure protec-\ntion, hundreds of detector thresholds with varying time re-\nsponses are precisely configured for each beam mode, ion \nspecies, and energy. The Threshold Configuration Tool \n(TCT), a sophisticated software solution, optimizes these \nthresholds to safeguard the machine while minimizing \nfalse trips. Additionally, FRIBâs high-power beam employs \na novel self-healing liquid lithium film charge stripper, \nwhich introduces beam energy fluctuations and occasional \ngaps in the film, leading to downstream losses. Fast and \nslow feedback syste",
        "LINAC OVERVIEW": "The FRIB linac, utilizing superconducting RF cavities \nand consisting of over 500 meters of beamline, is designed \nto eventually deliver up to 400 kW of sustained heavy ion \nbeam power to target. FRIB first delivered 1 kW of contin-\nuous beam power on target in May 2022 [1]. Since then, \nthe maximum beam power on target has been steadily in-\ncreasing, up to 2025 where we regularly deliver 20 kW of \nUranium on target.  Beam loss detection and mitigation has \nbeen a requirement from the start, and we have a robust \nMachine Protection System (MPS) [2] with an extensive \nnetwork of sensors, detectors, controllers, and data acqui-\nsition systems which contribute not only diagnostic infor-\nmation, but fast-acting not-OK signals that can stop the \nbeam delivery within 15 Âµs in order to protect the machine. \nMachine Protection System \nThe Machine Protection System is one the most im-\nportant and complex systems at FRIB.  It directly connects \nto 400+ devices and controllers, with controllers i",
        "THRESHOLD CONFIGURATION TOOL \nFOR MPS": "The FRIB linac undergoes a wide range of beam opera-\ntions, each associated with varying levels of risk. At higher \nbeam power, the tolerances for Beam Loss Monitor (BLM) \nMachine Protection thresholds need to be tight. At lower \nbeam power, during beam tuning or beam development, \nthese thresholds should be more relaxed to permit activities \nsuch as RF cavity tuning, which necessarily generate a no-\nticeable but acceptable level of beam losses in certain lo-\ncations. \nWith hundreds of individual thresholds to configure for \na wide array of beam operating modes and a multi-dimen-\nsional problem space (ion species, beam energy, peak \npower, average power, pulsed modes, beam destination, \netc) a highly automated tool is the only way to avoid over-\n ___________________________________________  \n* This material is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of \nEnergy, Office of Science, Office of Nuclear Physics and used resources \nof the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) Operat",

        "LIQUID LITHIUM FILM STABILITY": "Fluctuations in beam energy can have a significant im-\npact on downstream beam losses. The liquid lithium film \nexperiences slow fluctuations due to thermal effects and \nother systemic drifts over time.  It also experiences sudden \nchanges in laminar flow, where the film thickness changes \ndue to laminar flow finding a new mode. These laminar \nflow changes happen within microseconds and may remain \nstable in the new mode anywhere from seconds to hours. \nFluctuations in film thickness result in changes to the post-\nstripper beam energy, which can result in beam losses \ndownstream, since the beam transport was tuned for a spe-\ncific energy profile.  To avoid frequent MPS faults in these \nscenarios, it is necessary to utilize beam diagnostics as \nfeedback to other systems which stabilize the beam energy \nand maintain the best possible transmission efficiency. Two \nindependent feedback mechanisms have been developed to \nmitigate these instabilities. \nFast Feedback: BPM-LLRF Feedback System",
        "CONCLUSION": "At FRIB, we have developed effective systems for de-\ntecting beam losses, machine protection, and mitigation of \nbeam instability to enable highly-reliable and relatively un-\ninterrupted beam delivery to experiments at up to 20 kW \nof continuous beam power while maintaining low residual \nactivation of our beamline.  We have effectively automated \nmuch of the machine protection configuration complexity \nthrough automated threshold configuration management \nwith our TCT.  Several sources of beam loss have been ef-\nfectively reduced by utilizing both fast and slow feedback \nsystems to stabilize beam energy, arrival time, and beam \ndistribution in the phase space. \nThese systems and tools have been critical in achieving \nstable operations for experiments at 20 kW.  As we ap-\nproach the next milestone of 50kW in the coming year, the \ndemand on these tools will only increase.  We will likely \nneed to extend these tools further, pushing them for faster \nresponse, or integrating additional fas",

Oka, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Tokyo, Japan\nAbstract\nThe Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source (ECRIS)\nplays a vital role in generating highly charged ion beams\nfor accelerator-based research. However, maintaining stable\nbeam intensities remains challenging due to unmeasurable\nor slowly varying internal states. This study proposes a\nmachine learning-based beam intensity prediction frame-\nwork that incorporates both numerical operational data and\nplasma light images acquired through the extraction elec-\ntrode. Experiments were conducted on two ion sources at",
        "INTRODUCTION": "The Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source (ECRIS)\nis a powerful tool, particularly for the production of highly\ncharged heavy ions. It is therefore widely used in accelerator\nfacilities. However, especially in the generation of metal-\nlic ion beams, the conditions within the ion source such as\nplasma parameters can change rapidly, making it difficult\nto maintain a stable beam over extended periods. Currently,\nthe operation relies on experienced operators performing\nmanual optimization. Our aim is to automate this optimiza-\ntion process by incorporating machine learning techniques,\nthereby enhancing the sophistication of ECRIS operations.\nAs a first step, we have developed a method for accurately\nmonitoring changes in ECRIS conditions and continuously\nmeasuring beam intensity without interrupting beam deliv-\nery.",
        "DATA COLLECTION": "In machine learning, the input data is of critical impor-\ntance. To effectively monitor changes in the ECRIS state,\nsufficient information must be supplied as model input. Op-\nerators typically monitor various parameters such as vac-\nuum pressure and drain current, in addition to operational\nparameters, when tuning the ECRIS. However, changes in\nâyasuyuki.morita@riken.jp\nsome parameters? such as vacuum level or vapor from high-\ntemperature ovens? occur gradually and with delay, making\nimmediate assessment difficult. Since not all internal states,\nlike oven temperature, are directly measurable, beam inten-\nsity may change gradually even when observable parameters\nremain constant. To capture such dynamics, we focused on\nacquiring information about plasma conditions. However,\nit is currently difficult to obtain plasma characteristics like\nelectron density and temperature without interfering with\nbeam delivery. As an alternative, we opted to capture plasma\nlight images using a camera [1]. ",

        "MODEL DESIGN": "To differentiate the predictive value of various types of\ndata, we constructed two types of models for both ion\nsources:\nâ¢ A model using only numerical data such as operational\nparameters.\nâ¢ A model using numerical data and plasma light images.\n(a) Conceptual diagram of the model with only numerical\nvalues.

Ratcliff\nFacility for Rare Isotope Beams, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA\nJ. Qiang\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, One Cyclotron Road, Berkeley, CA, USA\nAbstract\nJuTrack is a novel accelerator modeling and tracking pack-\nage developed in the Julia programming language. Taking\nadvantage of compiler-level automatic differentiation (AD),\nJuTrack allows rapid and accurate derivative calculations\nfor arbitrary differentiable functions. This paper introduces\nthe core capabilities of JuTrack, including lattice modeling\nand particle tracking, and demonstrates how AD-derived\nderivatives enhance the efficiency of beam physics studies\nthrough several practical examples.",
        "INTRODUCTION": "Derivatives are important in scientific computing tasks,\nsuch as accelerator modeling and particle tracking simu-\nlation. Traditional approaches to calculate derivatives pri-\nmarily involve numerical and symbolic methods. While\nnumerical methods can approximate derivatives for com-\nplex systems, they often suffer from precision limitations\ndue to truncation errors and round-off errors, especially\nfor ill-conditioned problems. On the other hand, symbolic\nmethods, though accurate, struggle with deriving analytical\nexpressions for complicated systems.\nTo address these challenges, automatic differentiation\n(AD) emerges as a robust alternative [1]. AD is a kind\nof computational technique used to evaluate the derivatives\nof functions in computer programs. Unlike numerical differ-\nentiation and symbolic differentiation, AD calculates deriva-\ntives of functions by decomposing functions into elementary\noperations and applying the chain rule to these operations\nsequentially. This method not only",
        "ACCELERATOR MODELING": "Figure 1 shows the structure of the JuTrack code. It in-\ncludes four main parts: lattice functions, TPSA functions,\ntracking functions, and utility functions. As a particle track-\ning tool, JuTrack supports 6-D tracking of the particle co-\nordinates [ð¥, ðð¥, ð¦, ðð¦, ð§, ð¿], where ð¥and ð¦are the transverse\ncoordinates, ðð¥and ðð¦are the transverse momentum nor-\nmalized by the reference particle momentum ð0, ð§is the\npath lengthening with respect to the reference particle, and\nð¿= ð¿ð/ð0 is the momentum deviation with respect to the\nreference particle.\nIn addition to standard particle tracking, JuTrack also\nsupports calculation of TPSA. The 6-D coordinates\n[ð¥, ðð¥, ð¦, ðð¦, ð§, ð¿] can be represented as coefficients of six\npolynomials and tracked as standard 6-D particle coordinates.\nThe results of the TPSA tracking are also six polynomials\nrepresenting the 6-D coordinates.\nFigure 1: Overview of the JuTrack workflow. JuTrack ap-\nplies AD to compute derivatives of both map coefficients\nand beam observa",

        "AUTO DIFFERENTIATION": "Derivatives of Particle Tracking Results\nJuTrack allows automatic calculation of derivatives for ar-\nbitrary differentiable functions. The differentiated function\ncan be the calculation of any differentiable lattice parameters\nand related simulation results. The inputs of the function\nare usually design parameters of the accelerator, such as\nparameters of magnets and RF cavities.\nTaking a simple beam line [Q1, D1, Q2, D2] as an ex-\nample, where Q1 and Q2 represent quadrupoles, and D1\nand D2 represent drift space. A particle starting with ini-\ntial coordinates [1eâ3, 1eâ4, 0, 0, 0, 0] is tracked through\nthe sequence of the transport line. The strengths of the two\nquadrupoles, ð1 and ð2, are used as input variables of the\ndifferentiable function. The outputs of the function are 6-D\ncoordinates of the particle at the exit of the beam line.\nTable 1 shows the automatically obtained derivatives of\nthe final 6-D coordinates with respect to ð1 and ð2 when\nð1 = 1.0 mâ2 and ð2 = â1.0 mâ2.

        "CONCLUSION": "An AD-enabled accelerator modeling code is in devel-\nopment based on Julia. The capabilities of this AD code\nare demonstrated through its application to a single-particle\ntracking scenario. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to op-\ntimize Twiss parameters of a storage ring accelerator using\nthe automatically calculated derivatives.\nThe package is available at https://github.com/",

        "DESIGN IMPROVEMENT OF A MINICHANNEL BEAM DUMP WING": "THROUGH AI-DRIVEN GENETIC ALGORITHMS* \nG. Leeâ , N. Bultman, T. Kanemura, M. Patil, R. Quispe-Abad, J. Song \nFacility for Rare Isotope Beams, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA\nAbstract \nThe Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) requires its \nbeam dump to handle an increase in primary beam power \nfrom 20 kW to 50 kW. This paper presents a hybrid opti-\nmization framework that combines a Genetic Algorithm \n(GA) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning \nto enhance the beam dumpâs thermal performance for \n50 kW operation. The GA conducts a global search for key \ngeometric design variables, while a SAC agent fine-tunes \nthe local geometry to create a uniform heat distribution. \nThe optimized design successfully lowered the maximum \ntemperature across a range of beam sizes, achieving a \nnearly uniform temperature profile and enabling safe oper-\nation at 50 kW. A 3D simulation confirmed the design's \neven surface temperature and an 86% increase in power-\nhandling capab",
        "INTRODUCTION": "Beam dumps are the heat removal system directing un-\nused beam power for heat removal. FRIBâs current beam \ndump is a static, water-cooled structure where the beam \nstrikes at a shallow angle (~6Â°) to spread out the energy \ndeposition [1]. As FRIB upgrades its beam power from \n20 kW to 50 kW, the existing dump design needs to be im-\nproved to handle the greater thermal load [2]. The primary \ngoal is to prevent excessive localized heating by optimiz-\ning the geometry. This ensures that heat is distributed more \nevenly across the dumpâs surface for various beam sizes. \nTraditional engineering approaches struggle to optimize \nthis problem, as they cannot easily account for the many \ninterconnected geometric variables and multi-condition re-\nquirements. Therefore, advanced optimization techniques \nare needed. \nGenetic Algorithms (GAs) are well-suited for such tasks \nand have been widely applied to complex engineering op-\ntimization problems due to their ability to perform global \nsearches ",
        "METHOD": "The beam dump consists of a bi-metal main plate and \ntwo 3D-printed side wings that are attached to cover mul-\ntiple beam sizes. The bi-metal plate is a copper alloy (Cu-\nCrZr) bonded to an aluminium alloy (Al 2219) layer using \nexplosion bonding on the beam-facing side [5-6]. This de-\nsign combines high thermal conductivity with a protective \naluminium layer to reduce water activation. \nThe optimization targeted a 238U beam with a 2.1 mm \nthick graphite target. As shown in Fig. 1, four representa-\ntive beam sizes (Ïð¥ð¥, Ïð¦ð¦) were selected to cover a wide op-\nerational range: (2.11, 7.68), (2.90, 14.20), (5.10, 19.25), \nand (6.97, 25.98), with units in mm. \n \nFigure 1: Variation of beam size with 238U momentum de-\nviation. \nA custom 2D Finite Difference Method (FDM) thermal \nsimulation code was developed in Python to reduce the ex-\ntensive simulation time required by the GA and SAC algo-\nrithms. As shown in Fig. 2, this code divides the dump into \nfour sections (S1âS4) corresponding to ",

        "RESULTS": "The hybrid optimization approach produced an im-\nproved geometry for the FRIB beam dump, leading to re-\nductions in peak temperature and a substantial increase in \noperational power handling. Figure 3 illustrates the GA op-\ntimization process over 500 generations. Initially, the max-\nimum temperatures exceeded 600Â°C but rapidly declined, \nstabilizing at 314.5 Â°C with consistent temperatures across \nall sigma cases. \n \nFigure 3: Genetic Algorithm temperature trend by genera-\ntion. \nSubsequently, the SAC reinforcement learning algo-\nrithm refined the geometry further, as shown in Fig. 4. Dur-\ning 500 reinforcement learning episodes, the peak temper-\nature, which started at the 314.5Â°C inherited from the GA \nsolution, progressively dropped to approximately 311Â°C. \nThis was accompanied by a consistent rise in the reward, \nindicating effective local geometric refinement. \n \nFigure 4: Reinforcement Learning temperature and reward \ntrend by episode. \nA visual comparison of the original and op",
        "CONCLUSION": "This study confirms that combining a Genetic Algorithm \nfor global exploration with reinforcement learning for local \nfine-tuning is an effective method for achieving significant \nimprovements in thermal performance. The new geometry \nsubstantially reduced maximum temperatures, created a \nmore uniform temperature distribution, and boosted power \nhandling capability by an average of 86%. These outcomes \nprovide a foundation for the practical implementation of \nthe new design at FRIB and demonstrate the potential of \nthis methodology for similar high-power accelerator com-\nponents and other heat removal systems. Future work will \nfocus on refining these optimization techniques to create \neven smoother geometric shapes capable of handling \nhigher primary beam power limits.",

Brown1,2â ,W. Chang1, S. Kim1, T. Xu1,2, S. Zhao1, 1Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, East Lansing, MI, USA 2Department of Physics and Astronomy, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA Abstract Superconducting radio-frequency niobium cavities are susceptible to deformations caused by external or internal forces, leading to shifts in the cavity resonant frequency. One source of deformation comes from the radiation pres- sure of the cavity fields, producing the so-called Lorentz force detuning effect. This effect can couple to the cavity mechanical modes in a generator-driven mode, leading to the ponderomotive instability. In the FRIB 322 MHz, ð½= 0.53 Half-Wave Resonators (HWR), the instability appeared when the cavity was detuned, with thresholds depending on low- level RF control parameters, such as closed loop gain, as well as the accelerating gradient. Using a measured Lorentz transfer function, Simulink simulations were conducted to predict the instability thresholds, which were then compared with experimental results. We find good agreement for sim- ulated and experimental thresholds on the negative side of the resonance curve and note inconsistencies with theory for proportional feedback systems and discuss paths forward for analytical studies. INTRODUCTION The ð½= 0.53 Half-Wave Resonator The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is a heavy ion, superconducting (SC), continuous wave (CW) linear accel- erator capable of accelerating 238U ions to 200 MeV/u [1]. The acceleration schemes employs ð½= 0.53, 322 MHz half- wave resonators (HWRs) as the highest beta cavity among four different types of SC cavities. The field profiles for the ð½= 0.53 HWR from CST Studio [2] are shown in Fig. 1. The capacitance ð¶is built up in the high electric field regions such as the accelerating gaps whereas the inductance ð¿is formed in the high magnetic field regions of the cavity periphery. These two factors thus determine the resonance frequency of the cavity ð0 via: ð0 = 1 âð¿ð¶ . (1) Since the capacitance and inductance are determined by the geometry, changes to the geometry result in a change in ð0, which leads to a detuning from the generator fre- quency. CW linac operation allows for the choice of using âThis material is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of High Energy Physics, under Award Number DE-SC0018362 and Office of Nuclear Physics and used resources of the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) Operations, which is a DOE Office of Science User Facility under Award Number DE-SC0023633. â  brownjac@frib.msu.edu Figure 1: Fundamental electric field (left) and magnetic field(right). Internal energy normalized to 1 J . relatively high ððð¥ð¡couplers, due to relatively weak beam loading effects compared to pulsed machines. This leads reduced RF power costs with narrow bandwidths. In this case, it is necessary to maintain frequency excursions due to detuning effects at the level of the loaded bandwidth or lower. Otherwise, the RF power required for amplitudes and phase stabilities could be even higher than the case of using a lower ððð¥ð¡couplers (a larger bandwidth) [3]. In this work, we focus on a specific type of detuning effects: the Lorentz force detuning effect and the possible instabilities that can arise from its presence. Lorentz Force Detuning The RF fields in the cavity produce a radiative/Lorentz pressure on the walls of the cavity, leading to deformations. As such, this Lorentz pressure detunes the cavity. This effect can be divided into static and dynamic effects, depending on its coupling with the cavityâs mechanical vibrational modes. Static Lorentz Force Detuning In a steady-state case, as is most applicable to CW operation, the Lorentz pressure causes a static shift ð¿ðin the resonance frequency. This shift is proportional to the square of the accelerating gradient ð¸ððð[4]: ð¿ð= âðð¿ð¸2ððð, (2) where ðð¿is the so-called static Lorentz force detuning (LFD) coefficient. This coefficient is geometry dependent and relates the effect of deformation/detuning to the acceler- ating field. This ponderomotive effect also creates a tilt in the reso- nance curve of the cavity as shown in Fig. 2, where a hystere- sis region is created on the lower branch of the resonance curve. This now opens the door to the first kind of pondero- motive instability: the monotonic or jump instability. 16th International Conference on Heavy Ion Accelerator Technology,Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA JACoW Publishing ISBN: 978-3-95450-260-8 ISSN: 2673-5547 doi: 10.18429/JACoW-HIAT2025-WEP19 246 MC2: Room Temperature and Superconducting Linacs WEP19 WEP: Wednesday Poster Session: WEP Content from this work may be used under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 licence (Â© 2022).

Figure 2: Normal resonance curve of the cavity (top) and resonance curve in the presence of the Lorentz pressure without amplitude feedback and/or tuning (bottom). ðis the cavity electrical decay time. The monotonic/jump instability is characterized by a sud- den drop in field level and excitation of mechanical vibrations when passing from the upper branch of the resonance to the lower branch. This can be thought of as the cavity going from a higher energy, unstable equilibrium to the lower en- ergy, stable state. Amplitude feedback systems and in some cases, mechanical tuning of the cavity, can remove the tilting effect and thus greatly reduce the chance of this instability. Dynamic Lorentz Force Detuning In real cryomod- ule operations, modulation of the cavity field can occur at various frequencies due to microphonics. If the modula- tion frequency is close to the resonance frequency of one of the cavityâs mechanical vibrational modes (frequencies denoted by Î©ð), the mechanical mode can couple to the modulation of the RF field, leading to an increased detun- ing effect. These dynamic effects can be described by the Lorentz transfer function, defined in the Laplace domain as [4]: ð¿ðð¹(ð ) = â2ð¸ðððâ ð ððÎ©2ð ð 2 + (2/ðð)ð + Î©2ð , (3) where ððis the mechanical mode decay time and ððis a LFD coefficient specific to mode ð. This function can be measured and the effects of modulation at mechanical resonance can be clearly seen, as shown in Fig. 3. We now discuss the second kind of ponderomotive insta- bility: the oscillatory instability. This instability appears on the positive branch of the resonance curve, and can occur when the cavity field is modulated and there is non-zero static detuning.

        "4. There are a few possible paths to unstable behavior from here. If the cavity is being operated in an open loop and the external modulation persists, the above steps will repeat until RF interlocks on the minimum cavity field engage or the external modulation stops. If there is phase feedback systems present with insufficient gain, the low-level RF (LLRF) controller will send more power to the cavity to keep the phase setpoint without end. The above steps can repeat until the RF interlocks on the maximum RF power engage. The schematic of the oscillatory instability and experi- mental example can be seen in Fig. 4. This instability can be suppressed with additional amplitude feedback systems in the LLRF controller, a component of feedback present in all accelerator operations. Sufficient amplitude control would stop this loop at step 2, leading to no runaway effect. GOALS AND METHODOLOGY FRIB employs active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) algorithms [5], which use extended state ob- servers (ESOs) for feedback on cavity amplitude and phase. 16th International Conference on Heavy Ion Accelerator Technology,Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA JACoW Publishing ISBN: 978-3-95450-260-8 ISSN: 2673-5547 doi: 10.18429/JACoW-HIAT2025-WEP19 MC2: Room Temperature and Superconducting Linacs 247 WEP: Wednesday Poster Session: WEP WEP19 Content from this work may be used under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 licence (Â© 2022).

Figure 5: Simulink model of FRIB feedback+cavity code. The static offset feature can be seen in the bottom middle. ADRC is a non-linear process unlike traditional proportional- integral-differential control. Ponderomotive instability was encountered during production for FRIB in 2020, and was then suppressed empirically using higher amplitude feedback gains. We therefore seek to better understand the behavior of these instabilities in the presence of this non-linear feedback system. To model the cavity and feedback systems, we use a Simulink model adopted from [6]. A schematic of our system can be seen in Fig. 5. We have incorporated the measured LTF to feedback detuning values into the cavity electrical equations. A static detuning offset has been added as well to detune the cavity up to Â±45â(half-bandwidth) and record instability onset to compare with experimental measurements in the linac. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We present the results from our Simulink model (dots) and experimental measurements (diamonds) in Fig. 6. We swept through 4 different amplitude controller gains and 3 different ð¸ððð. In general, we observed that the instability thresholds decrease with increased ð¸ððð, certifying that these phenomena are related to the Lorentz pressure. There is some inconsistent behavior seen in both experi- ment and simulation. On the positive side, our simulation predicts no instability within +45âfor all choices of field and gains. We see that is not represented for measurements at ð¸ððð=7.4 MV/m and 8.1 MV/m. Additionally we see in a Figure 6: Plot of instability threshold in terms of static detun- ing versus amplitude controller gain. Results for simulation and experiment are shown for 3 different fields. few cases that the instability threshold decreased (not all) as we moved to higher controller gains, which is not consistent with an established theory of the ponderomotive instability relating to proportional, linear feedback systems [7,8]. We now discuss the negative side results. As we employ amplitude feedback systems to correct the static effect, we expect that the negative side to be instability free. However, we see that both simulation and measurement shows insta- bilities. In experiment, we see a growth in field and phase that we associate with the oscillatory instability rather than the rapid drop in field of the monotonic instability when detuned to the negative side. These two facts suggest that the instabilities we see on the negative side are in some way related to our LLRF controller. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK We have presented a method to predict instability thresh- olds in SRF cavities and showcased preliminary results com- pared to experimental measurements; there is good agree- ment between simulation and experiment for higher ampli- tude controller gains on the negative side of the resonance curve. We note some inconsistencies from existing theory for proportional theory. To better understand the root cause for these phenomena, we will be conducting an analytical study of closed loop transfer functions for ADRC feedback. This will help us in understanding the connection between ADRC and the Lorentz transfer function and open up doors to further suppress these effects, as well as understand the discrepancies between simulation and measurement on the positive side.

Plastun\nFacility for Rare Isotope Beams, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA\nAbstract\nThe Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) linear accel-\nerator is capable of simultaneously transporting and accel-\nerating multiple-charge-state heavy-ion beams. Accurate\ntransverse and longitudinal matching of these beams is a\nchallenging problem, particularly in achromatic bending\nsegments of the linac. To solve it, we employ both macropar-\nticle tracking and linear optics codes. The simulation mod-\nels are being developed, cross-checked, and validated by\nbeam measurements. The studies are focused on the beam\nsize, envelope matching, charge state separation, and the\nresponse of the beam position. The results of the studies\nwith the 16.5 MeV/u five-charge-state uranium beam will be\npresented.",
        "INTRODUCTION": "Charge stripping is essential for efficient acceleration of\nheavy-ion beams. When a heavy-ion beam is stripped, the\nresulting charge distribution is a Gaussian function centered\non the mean charge state. The mean and standard deviation\nof this Gaussian depends on many factors like beam velocity,\natomic mass of ions in the beam, stripper material and strip-\nper thickness. For optimal placing of a 17 MeV/u uranium\nbeam on the most uniform area of the FRIB liquid lithium\nstripper, a mean charge state of 75+ with 21% of initial beam\nintensity is produced [1]. Therefore, the post-stripper seg-\nments of the FRIB driver linac were designed to accept and\nsimultaneously accelerate multiple charge states and deliver\nthem to the target. In March 2025, we developed the linac\ntune to produce 20 kW of uranium beam on the target by\naccelerating five charge states after the stripper.\nTo support the beam dynamics optimization and simula-\ntions in the FRIB linac, two codes are used: TRACK [2] and",

        "CONCLUSION": "Improvements were made to the FLAME model to better\nmatch simulations to the behavior of the beam in the driver\nlinac. A TRACK model of FS1 with 3D fields for all dipole\nand quadrupole magnets was created and verified with BPM\ntrajectory measurements. To fit the results of the FLAME\nsimulation to the TRACK and BPM results, FLAME dipole\nfringe-field focusing and the effective lengths of FLAME\nquadrupoles were updated and non-linear sextupole compo-\nnents were added to the FLAME dipole model. As evidenced\nby Figs. 1 and 6, these updates produced a clear improve-\nment in the FLAME model. Recently, we used the updated",

        "USA": "2Department of Mechanical Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA \nAbstract \nA variable wedge degrader system has been developed \nat the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) to purify in-\nflight rare isotope beams. The system incorporates three in-\ndependently movable wedge pairs: two with quadratic pro-\nfiles for angle tuning (covering 3â20â¯mrad) and one with a \nlinear profile for fine thickness adjustment. To support ex-\nperiments at FRIBâs DB2 location, the system maintains an \napproximately linear relationship between beam angle and \ncenter thickness, typically following Angle â 1.2 Ã Thick-\nness, resulting in a thickness range of 2.5 â 16.67â¯mm. An \nautomated MATLAB-based controller selects the appropri-\nate operating modeâhigh-angle or low-angleâand calcu-\nlates wedge positions and virtual stepper motor steps ac-\ncordingly. Simulations confirm the system achieves target \nangle-thickness combinations across most of the range, \nwith larger deviations observe",
        "INTRODUCTION": "Wedge-shaped degraders are widely used for in-flight \npurification of rare isotope beams, a technique first imple-\nmented at GANILâ¯ [1]. By placing a degrader at a disper-\nsive focal plane, energy loss becomes position-dependent, \ncreating an achromatic focus downstream and enabling ion \nseparation based on magnetic rigidityâ¯ [2â4]. This approach \nhas been adopted in fragment separators at RIKEN â¯[5, 6],",
        "DESIGN": "The 6-piece variable wedge system is designed to make \neach pair operate via symmetric displacement of its com-\nponents to achieve the desired configuration. Based on the \ninput angle and center thickness, the system automatically \nselects the appropriate mode and moves the unused pair(s) \noutside the effective region (beyond Â±50â¯mm). This design \nallows for continuous and decoupled adjustment of both \nangle and thickness across the operational range. \nThe general form of the thickness-versus-position func-\ntion for a wedge pair under symmetric displacement is de-\nfined as follows: \n  ð¦ð¦â = âðð(ð¥ð¥)â = ððððáð¥ð¥â\n1\n2 âð¥ð¥á+ ððððáð¥ð¥+\n1\n2 âð¥ð¥á \n(1) \nFor High Angle Wedges (â¥7 mrad), \nðð1,2(ð¥ð¥) = 2(âðð1âð¥ð¥+ ðð1)ð¥ð¥+ (ðð1 + ðð2)  \n(2) \nSimilarly, for Low Angle Wedges (<7 mrad), \nðð3,4(ð¥ð¥) = 2(âðð3âð¥ð¥+ ðð3)ð¥ð¥+ (ðð3 + ðð4)  \n(3) \nFor Linear Shaped Wedges, \nðð5,6(ð¥ð¥) = âðð5âð¥ð¥+ (ðð5 + ðð6)  \n \n(4) \nWhere, \nâ¢ fi(x) is the stacked thickness of the ith wedge as a \nfunction of transverse position, x. x",

        "DISCUSSION": "To evaluate system performance, a representative simu-\nlation was performed with an input angle of 10â¯mrad and \ncenter thickness of 8.33â¯mm. The system automatically se-\nlected High-Angle mode, computed the center positions of \nactive wedges, and translated these into step counts for \nstepper motor actuation. Unused wedge pairs were re-\ntracted beyond the effective range (Â±50â¯mm), with their po-\nsitions set to Â±200â¯mm. All wedges started moving at posi-\ntion x =0.

The Simulink-\nbased control logic has been fully verified in simulation. \nFuture work will focus on building a physical prototype, \noptimizing the quadratic wedge profile to reduce devia-\ntions observed at 4â5â¯mrad, and exploring material selec-\ntion and fabrication methods for implementation.",

        "USA": "Abstract \nSilicon carbide (SiC) has several properties such as \nwide band gap and high voltage breakdown, that give it a \nsignificant advantage over silicon for the next generation \nof medium and high frequency applications. To fully real-\nize these advantages, requires deep ion implantation \n(~>6 Âµm). Unfortunately, the energy of conventional ion \nimplanters limits the implantation depth in SiC to approxi-\nmately 1Âµm. Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) has \ndeveloped a system that uses the 15 MV MP-class Tandem \nVan de Graaffs to implant ions in SiC to a depth >15 Âµm. \nBy changing the ion beam energy in discrete steps, the \noverlapping implantations can build a uniform implanta-\ntion profile from the maximum implantation depth to the \nsurface. To implant ions near the surface of the SiC wafer \nrequires the use of an energy absorber to degrade the ion \nenergy from 10âs of MeV to a few keV.

        "INTRODUCTION": "The Tandem Van de Graaff Facility [1] at Brookhaven \nNational Laboratory (BNL) (Fig. 1) consists of two MP-\nclass tandems (MP6 and MP7) (Fig. 2). Each tandem can \nbe operated independently at a terminal voltage of >14 MV. \nThe tandems are connected to the BNL Booster synchro-\ntron by a 900 m long transfer line and can provide a variety \nof ion species (from protons to gold) for use at the Relativ-\nistic Heavy ion Collider (RHIC) and the NASA Space Ra-\ndiation Laboratory (NSRL). The tandems can also supply \nion beams to two local target rooms (TR2 and TR4) for \nspace and industrial applications.  \nFigure 1: The BNL Tandem Van de Graaff Facility.",
        "HIGH ENERGY IMPLANTER": "The high energy implanter [2] at BNL, uses an existing \nbeam line in target room 2. The beam line has the unique \nfeature that the diameter of the beam pipe increases from \n100 mm to 710 mm just before the end vacuum chamber. \nThis feature of the beam line allows the beam to be swept \nhorizontally over a large area. \nThe implanter (Fig. 3) consists of a pair of horizontal de-\nflector plates, an aluminium foil energy absorber, a series \nof Faraday cups for beam diagnostics and a vertical linear \nstage on to which the SiC wafers are mounted. The deflec-\ntor plates sweep the beam horizontally at 400 Hz while the \nlinear stage drives the wafers vertically through the swept \nion beam at 10 mm/sec. This relatively slow speed ensures \nthat the implantation is uniform over the entire wafer. \n ___________________________________________  \n* Work supported by Brookhaven Science Associates, LLC under Con-\ntract No. DE-SC0012704 with the US Department of Energy \nâ  steski@bnl.gov \n16th Internationa",

        "ENERGY FILTERED IMPLANTATION": "Another idea to reduce the SiC lattice damage during the \nhigh energy implantation is to use Energy Filtered Ion Im-\nplantation (EFII) [4] technology. The energy filter (Fig.8) \nis a micropatterned silicon membrane that replaces the alu-\nminum energy absorber. The energy filter converts a mo-\nnoenergetic ion beam to an ion beam with a uniform energy \nspread. \nThis will reduce the dose rate at a specific depth and po-\ntentially reduce the lattice damage. It will also eliminate \nthe need to use multiple beam energies from the tandem, \npotentially shortening the time required for the entire im-\nplantation. \nFor an initial test, a flat profile EFII was used with a \n90 MeV Al beam. This was implanted into a silicon wafer. \nThe SIMS analysis (Fig. 9) showed a flat profile from the \nsurface to a depth of 26 Âµm. \nAnother test was conducted using both the EFFI and \nheated wafer system. These wafers will be sent out for",
        "CONCLUSION": "Brookhaven National Laboratory has developed a high \nenergy ion implanter capable of implanting ions in silicon \ncarbide to a depth of >12 Âµm. The system has been up-\ngraded to heating the SiC wafers during the implantation \nprocess. The use of an energy filter is also being investi-\ngated to reduce damage to the SiC lattice and to reduce the \noverall implantation time. Although all of the work to date \nhas involved Al and N ions for implantation in SiC, the \nsame principles can be extended to the implantation of gal-\nlium nitride (GaN) or any other material as long as suffi-\ncient quantities of the desired negative ion can be pro-\nduced.",

        "DIMENSIONAL BEAM MATCHING WITH LINEAR": "ACCELERATOR STRUCTURES* \nY.K. Batyginâ , Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA \nAbstract \nBeam matching is a common technique routinely em-\nployed in accelerator design to minimize beam losses and \npreserve beam quality. A matched beam occupies the \nsmallest volume in 6D phase space, leading to improved \nbeam brightness, a measure of the beam's quality. Six-di-\nmensional beam matching involves adjusting beam param-\neters to match the accelerator's lattice. Here we present an \nanalytical treatment of 6D beam matching of a high-inten-\nsity beam onto an RF structure. We discuss the application \nof the averaging method to attain an analytical solution for \na set of matched 3D beam envelope equations. We then \nconsider the more general self-consistent approach to beam \nequilibrium in 6D phase space based on Hamiltonian anal-\nysis. Finally, we discuss the role of the equipartitioning \nconcept in beam matching.",

        "INTRODUCTION": "Radio-frequency (RF) cavities are fundamental compo-\nnents in particle accelerators, shaping electromagnetic fields\nto accelerate charged particles. Precise field measurements\nare essential for ensuring cavity performance aligns with\ndesign specifications, particularly for applications in high-\nenergy physics and medical accelerators. The bead-pull\nmethod, rooted in Slaterâs perturbation theory [1], has been\nthe standard for mapping field distributions by measuring\nfrequency shifts induced by a bead moved through the cavity\nvia a wire-pulley system. However, this method faces chal-\nlenges, including mechanical complexities, wire-induced\nperturbations (especially for higher-order modes), and time-\nconsuming setup processes.\nTo address these limitations, we developed a bead-falling\nmeasurement method, as detailed in [2], which eliminates\nthe wire-pulley system by using free-falling beads or droplets\nto perturb the cavity field. This technique simplifies the ex-\nperimental setup, reduces ",
        "CONCEPTUAL DESIGN\nAND ADVANTAGES": "The bead-falling method induces perturbations by releas-\ning a bead or droplet to fall freely through the RF cavity\nalong the beam axis, with a VNA capturing resulting phase\nor frequency shifts (Fig. 1). The beadâs position is correlated\nwith time using kinematic equations, accounting for gravita-\ntional acceleration, to map the field distribution accurately.\nFigure 1: Scheme of bead-fall RF-measurements. The cavity\nis connected to two of the VNA ports. The device includes\nthe bead/droplet release system and the bead detector. It is\npositioned such that the falling bead is aligned to the beam\naxis of the cavity. Beads are released from the top and fall\nfreely through the bead-detector and subsequently through\nthe cavity.\nCompared to the bead-pull method, this approach offers\nseveral advantages:\nâ¢ enhanced precision: small beads (0.5â1 mm) mini-\nmize field variations across their volume, and the ab-\nsence of a wire eliminates perturbations, particularly\nfor dipole modes.\nâ¢ rapid measure",

        "CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK": "The opportunity to extensively test the pulsed gas stripper\nbefore the system is completed and ready for regular opera-\ntion was unexpected and on short notice. Nevertheless, after\na short preparation period, about one year of successful oper-\nation during two user beam times was achieved and yielded\nresults, which could not have been gained otherwise. Sev-\neral issues have been identified or confirmed, some of them\nbeing anticipated. Some improvements have already been\nimplemented and tested, others are planned to be realized\nsoon. The latest status report of the pulsed hydrogen gas\nstripper project with more details is available in [9]. Valu-\nable experiences and a significant amount of stripping data\nwas acquired for a broad range of ion species, demonstrating\nthat the performance of the pulsed gas stripper covers all\noperational expectations.\nThe main parts remaining for the completion of the pulsed\nstripper are the automated gas control station and the inte-\ngration into the accel",
        "INTRODUCTION": "The GSI accelerator facility, in particular the UNILAC\n(UNIversal Linear ACcelerator) and the heavy ion syn-\nchrotron SIS18, serve as injector for the upcoming Facility\nfor Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR), the commissioning\nof which will start in 2026. High intensity ion beams are pro-\nvided by dedicated high current sources and pre-accelerated\nby the high current injector (HSI). The HSI is designed for\nhandling ions with a mass-to-charge-ratio of up to ð´/ð= 65,\nsince the ions delivered by the high current sources have\ninherently low charge states [1]. A gas stripper is necessary\nto increase the charge state to enable efficient acceleration in\nthe subsequent Alvarez drift tube linac. Stripping is applied\nat 1.4 MeV/u after acceleration in the HSI. Until recently,\na continuous nitrogen gas jet was employed as stripping\ntarget [2]. Out of the charge state spectrum resulting from\nthe stripping process, one charge state has to be separated\nfor further acceleration. For heavy ions like u",
        "DEVELOPMENT SETUP\nAND RECENT UPGRADES": "A second generation stripper setup (Fig. 1) was designed\nafter it was found during the proof-of-principle that the orig-\ninal valves would break down after only a few hours of\noperation [7]. It contains two fast injection valves of a new\nFigure 1: Sketch of the current pulsed stripper setup. The\nfast injection valve is indicated in red.

        "MODUS OPERANDI": "Since the current development stripper setup was never\nintended to be used for regular long-term operation, there\nwas no automation or remote operation and monitoring fore-\nseen. Partial remote control of the stripper was enabled by\nsimply using remote access to a PC, which was used to con-\ntrol the setup locally. By this, the valve controller and later\nalso the electronic pressure controller (see below) as well as\nmonitoring of the gas flow was remotely accessible. Still,\nmany settings and the daily inspections and manual logging\nhave to be done locally. This is especially true for the gas\nhandling, because all valves and pressure gauges are manu-\nally operated only, as were the two mechanical low-pressure\nregulators used during beam time 2024. The only valves\nautomated are the two safety cut-off valves.\nDespite the improvements done, the stripper remained\nbeing an expert system. Unlike the jet stripper, there was\nno control and, due also to technical limitations, no mon-\nitoring of t",
        "LESSONS LEARNED": "During the first user beam time it quickly became evident\nthat, due to the restrictions mentioned above, a simple op-\nerating scheme had to be devised in order to minimize the\nFigure 2: Foto of the gas control for the pulsed gas stripper. In the green frame are the two manual low-pressure regulators\nadded early in 2024 (top and center) and the electronic pressure controller installed later (bottom).\n16th International Conference on Heavy Ion Accelerator Technology,Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA JACoW Publishing",
        "OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS": "In preparation for the beam time 2025, improvements\nbased on the lessons learned were implemented. In addition\nto the mechanical pressure regulators, an electronic pressure\ncontroller was installed, offering several advantages:\nâ¢ the connection to the local PC enabling remote setting\nand read out of the gas pressure;\nâ¢ the integrated, configurable PID controller provided\na precise feedback, mitigating the instability of the\nmechanical pressure regulators under changing opera-\ntional conditions;\nâ¢ any pressure within the range of the controller was\neasily achievable.\nThe only drawback observed so far were the comparatively\ncoarse settings at very low pressures, while the stability\nand precision of the controller was flawless even at the very\nlow settings, which are outside the recommended operating\nrange. At the same time, this was used to test the electronic\npressure controller extensively before its implementation in\nthe fully automated gas control station.\nThe very short service life",
        "STRIPPING DATA": "The beam time operation permitted the acquisition of\nstripping data for a large number of ion species. This is\ndifficult to achieve during dedicated machine development\nbeam times, because every change of the ion species requires\nan exchange of the ion source and a complete setup of the\nbeam up to the gas stripper, which takes up a lot of time. With\na new ion species set up during user beam time routinely\nevery few weeks, this now comes for free. The drawback\nis, that the time for data taking is extremely limited because\nit requires exclusive operation of the accelerator while the\nusers are already waiting for the beam. To support this,\nduring beam time 2025 the data taking was approved as an\nofficial accompanying machine experiment, allowing for â\n1 h of beam time per ion species.\nThe graphs in Fig. 4 show exemplary stripping data for\nlight, intermediate and heavy ions and the molecule CH3\nstripped by H2 or N2 as indicated in the upper left corner of\neach graph. The plotted data are p",

        "FRANZ": "The Frankfurt neutron source FRANZ is a small-scale\ncompact accelerator-based neutron source. It can deliver a\n30 mA proton beam with an energy of 2 MeV to a lithium\ntarget. The RFQ accelerates protons from 60 keV to 700 keV\nwithin 1.7 m (Fig. 5). A short IH-cavity directly coupled to\nthe RFQ provides 1.3 MV of additional voltage. The Linac\ncan provide almost any beam pulse scheme but can also be\noperated in cw mode. The RFQ has been commissioned up\nto 85 kW cw RF power. The beam tests showed a very high\ntransmission close to 100% [5].\nFigure 5: RFQ of the Frankfurt Neutron Source FRANZ.",
        "FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS": "Despite the significant progress made, further improve-\nments are planned. Conventional production methods have\nthe disadvantage that optimum cooling channels cannot be re-\nalized. This is where additive manufacturing (â3D-printingâ)\ncan be helpful. Therefore, it is planned to realize the inner\nstructure of the prototype using additive manufacturing, in\nparticular to improve cooling in areas with very high power\ndensity. The outer geometry of the resonance structure is\nto be retained so that the results can be better compared\nwith the existing prototype. In parallel, several issues as\nthermal conductivity, surface properties, erosion corrosion\nand dimensional stability are being adressed [10]. Figure\n8 shows the present cooling channels (left) and the cooling\nbased on additive manufacturing. In addition, a new RFQ\nFigure 8: Cooling channels with conventional manufacturing\n(left) and with additive manufacturing (right).\ndemonstrator is being under construction in close cooper-\nation bet",

In addition, a series of\nmeasures not mentioned here in the area of beam dynamics\nand end-field optimization have now led to extremely high\ntransmissions in operation.\nThis makes the 4-Rod RFQ an attractive alternative to the\n4-Vane RFQ for frequencies below 250 MHz not only for\nheavy ions but also for protons and deuterons in the context\nof high current accelerator based neutron sources.",

The lat-\ntice is a mirror-symmetric achromatic system. (Here, the \ncirculating energy is assumed to be constant, and details \nrelated to energy loss and recovery are neglected.) The he-\nlium stripper is placed at the symmetry plane of the achro-\nmatic section. \nEach time the beam passes through the stripper, the \ncharge state changes. Ideally, the ions continue to circulate \nwhile stochastically transitioning between charge states \nuntil they reach Uâ¶â´âº and are extracted. To avoid emittance \ngrowth due to mismatches among the eight optics configu-\nrations, the lattice is designed so that the phase-space ellip-\nses in all three dimensions at the stripper location (eigenel-\nlipse) are identical for all charge states.

A sim-\nplified simulation involving the injection of 105 beam \nbunches into CSR1 revealed that approximately 5Ã10âµ \nbunches circulated within the ring, resulting in the for-\nmation of over 55,000 distinct charge-state trajectories. \nThe Simpson diversity index calculated for this distribu-\ntion was 0.95, indicating an exceptionally high degree of \ncharge-state diversity. \nSuch a high degree of charge-state diversity implies that \nthe influence of resonance phenomena, typically a",

        "INTRODUCTION": "The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) started the\nscientific user program in May 2022 [1,2]. The driver linac\naccelerates all stable ions above 200 MeV/u onto the pro-\nduction target, and the Advanced Rare Isotope Separator\n(ARIS) [3,4] provides in-flight separation of projectile frag-\nments and fission fragments. Subsequently, the transfer\nhall beamlines deliver isotopes to user setups at experiment\nstations. The transfer hall setting is optimized for each ex-\nperiment to satisfy various usersâ requirements. We com-\nmissioned the S1 and S2 beamlines in 2025 and started user\nexperiments. Five experiment stations are currently in op-\neration. To optimize the performance of the transfer hall\nbeamline, we prepare and utilize a secondary beam from\nthe production target dedicated to tuning, the so-called pilot\nbeam.\nIn the following sections, we report on the beam tuning\nmethod to deliver the separated fragment beam to the user\nstations.",

        "CONCLUSION": "The isotope beam tuning approach based on the pilot\nbeam efficiently worked for the user experiments. Since all\nbeamlines consist of the smaller aperture quadrupoles and\nthe switching dipoles, the acceptance is noticeably lower\nthan the ARIS acceptance, which explains lower transmis-\nsion at larger emittances at DB5. The beamline components\nremain unchanged since the original operation with the cou-\npled cyclotrons at NSCL. By installing the High Rigidity\nSpectrometer (HRS) [8], we plan to improve the transmis-\nsion by close to 100%. Also, there are plans to upgrade all\nbeamlines with larger aperture quadrupoles and switching\ndipoles after the completion of the HRS project.\nIn addition, the beamline setup and the performance con-\nducted to date are archived in centralized storage, and plans\nare underway to utilize these data to automate the fine-tuning\nbased on the machine learning approach.\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nz [m]\n0\n10\n20\n30",

        "INTRODUCTION": "The ARIS separator uses magnetic rigidity separation \nand momentum-loss achromat methods with wedged \nshaped degraders to purify beams of isotopes according to \nmass and atomic number Z [1]. \nThe conceptual design was first introduced in a 2013 \npublication describing the optics and major components \n[2].

        "INTRODUCTION": "The production of radioactive beams is important for ad-\nvancing our understanding of the evolution of nuclear struc-\nture in atomic nuclei far from stability and for enabling\nthe study of key nuclei involved in stellar nucleosynthe-\nsis processes. At FRIB, radioactive beams are typically\nproduced via projectile fragmentation or in-flight abrasion-\nfission using various primary beams, from oxygen to ura-\nnium. These beams impinge on carbon targets [1] to produce\na wide range of nuclear fragments, which are predominantly\nlighter than the original projectile. These reaction products,\nwhich are produced at velocities close to that of the pro-\njectile and with a narrow momentum distribution, are then\nselected and purified using the ARIS separator [2].

        "RADIOACTIVE ION BEAM PRODUCTION": "SPES, standing for âSelective Production of Exotic\nSpeciesâ, is an INFN project aimed at developing a second-\ngeneration ISOL facility at the LNL [1]. The facility hosts\na B70 cyclotron (Fig. 1) produced by BEST Cyclotron Sys-\ntems operating at proton beam energy of 30 to 70 MeV with\nintensity up to 750 ÂµA. Such beams can be used for direct\nactivation or, if proper targets are used, to generate Radioac-\ntive Ion Beams (RIBs) with the ISOL technique. In SPES,\nthese targets are made of 7 disks of fissile materials, such\nas uranium carbide (UCx), or non-fissile materials, such as\nsilicon carbide (SiC) and titanium carbide (TiC) [2]. The\ndisks are spaced in a convenient way to obtain a uniform\ntemperature distribution inside the box. The exotic species\noriginating from the proton-induced nuclear reactions can\nleave the target box through a transfer line with a characteris-\ntic escape time depending on their chemical properties (e.g.,\nâalberto.arzenton@pd.infn.it\nâ  daiyuan.chen@phd.unipd.it",

        "PRECLINICAL APPLICATIONS": "Moving to medical applications, the main focus since\nalmost the very beginning of the project has been on silver-\n111, a ð½âemitter with half-life of 7.45 d and decay properties\nsuitable for nuclear medicine. In particular, its ð½âradiation,\nwith an average energy of about 360 keV, is very likely to be\nusable in radionuclide therapy, since its spectrum resembles\nthose of lutetium-177, already approved by FDA and EMA\n[11], and mostly rhenium-186, currently being studied in\nphase I/II clinical trials [12]. In addition, de-excitation ð¾\nrays (main peaks at 245 keV and 342 keV with 1% and 7%\nintensities) emitted after the ð½âdecay can be used for Single-\nPhoton Emission Tomography (SPECT) imaging, in such\na way to obtain a real-time screening of the therapeutic\napproaches [13]. With the ISOL technique at SPES, the\nexpectation is to produce â¼1 GBq of highly pure silver-111\nafter a 6-hour irradiation cycle using a UCx target, with the\ntypical amount required for ð½therapy in human patients\nbeing ",

Sev-\neral technical upgrades were implemented to expand the\nscientific capabilities, including a new BMIS source, a room-\ntemperature rebuncher, and the ReA6 accelerator with its\ncorresponding experimental vault.\nFollowing the commissioning of these upgrades, over 25\nbeams were delivered to experiments, including six long-\nlived RIBs: Be-7, Be-10, Al-26, Si-32, Ni-56 and As-73.\nIn this contribution, we outline the key steps that led to\nthe success of the stand-alone program, including a descrip-\ntion of the upgrades, results from the ReA6 commissioning,\napproaches to mitigating isobaric contamination, and future\nactivities for the ReA stand-alone program.",
        "INTRODUCTION": "The ReAccelerator (ReA) [1] at FRIB [2] at Michigan\nState University has proven to be a unique facility, reacceler-\nating stopped beams produced by in-flight fragmentation.\nIn 2021, when the Coupled Cyclotron Facility at National\nSuperconducting Cyclotron Laboratory [3] ceased opera-\ntions to accommodate preparations for FRIB, ReA continued\noperations in a stand-alone mode. Ever since FRIB started\nits scientific program in May 2022, stand-alone beams have\nbeen also available to users.\nAt FRIB, rare isotopes produced by in-flight fragmenta-\ntion are stopped using linear gas stoppers [4]. These beams\ncan be used for stopped beam experiments or injected into\nthe reaccelerator. Additional sources like the hot-cathode\ndischarge source or surface ionization source, and the Batch\nMode Ion Source (BMIS) [5] provide stable and long-lived\nrare isotope beams (RIB), respectively.\nAt the ReA front-end, an Electron Beam Ion Trap\n(EBIT) [6] defines the ion charge state for reacceleration.\nIons at 12 ",

        "UPGRADES FOR THE REA": "STAND-ALONE OPERATION\nBatch Mode Ion Source\nThe Batch Mode Ion Source (BMIS) was installed near the\ntwo gas cells, making use of existing beam lines to deliver\nbeams to both the low-energy and ReA areas (Fig. 1).\nFigure 1: BMIS module and extraction beam line.\nThe sample material is placed in an oven capable of reach-\ning temperatures up to 2000 âC. Heating the oven initiates\nthe evaporation of the sample. It has a gas handling system\nfor introducing a reactive and/or support gas on-line to en-\nhance this process. The resulting atoms are diffused through\na transfer tube, which is maintained at an even higher temper-\nature to facilitate the transport of ions to the ionizer. Various\ntypes of ionizers can be employed, such as a Forced Elec-\ntron Beam-Induced Arc Discharge (FEBIAD) ionizer or a\nsurface ionizer. These devices supply electrons to ionize the\nneutral atoms. The resulting ions are then extracted using\nan extraction electrode. The efficiency of beam extraction\ndepends on several",

        "BEAM CHARACTERIZATION": "User experiments at ReA usually request one isotope with\nhigh purity. The rate requested is dependent on the experi-\nmental setup used and the type of measurement performed.\nFor example, gas detectors can handle limited rates and will\nrequest high purities. When sending the beam to an experi-\nment, these properties have to be verified to not only ensure\nbeam quality but optimize the time for science.\nTo identify and determine the composition of the beam, sil-\nicon detectors in combination with degrader foils are strate-\ngically positioned along the ReA beam lines [9]. By select-\ning degrader foils of appropriate thicknesses, it becomes\npossible to separate and identify the beam of interest and\ncontaminants. For this, two systems are routinely used: one\nconsists of two independently actuated drives holding alu-\nminum foils followed by a surface-barrier silicon detector;\nthe other places an aluminum foil with a central aperture in\nfront of a silicon detector. Both operate on the same pri",
        "CONTAMINANT SUPPRESSION": "Given the limited resolution of the Q/A, beams acceler-\nated in ReA may be contaminated by isobars or isotopes with\nsimilar Q/A ratios. These contaminants are typically stable\nisotopes originating from materials in the sources or decay\nproducts of the rare isotope beams themselves. Reducing\nthe rate of contaminants is important to limit the detection\nsystem dead time and becomes determinant when the detec-\ntors resolution is limited impeding the identification of the\nevents of interest from contamination background. Several\nmethods have been employed to suppress the background.\nSelecting the appropriate charge state after the EBIT\ncharge breeder is critical to both acceleration efficiency and\nbeam purity. For example, choosing Be-7(4+) instead of\nBe-7(3+) helps avoid contamination from Li-7(3+). Never-\ntheless, choosing the optimal charge state cannot address all\ncases, such as the suppression of B-10 isobaric contamina-\ntion from the decay of Be-10 in the Be-10 beam.\nA beam with the l",
        "BMIS FUTURE ACTIVITIES FOR\nREA EXPERIMENTS": "In addition to the scientific research using long-lived rare\nisotopes, BMIS plays a key role to providing stable analogue\nbeams to set up the ReA accelerator, beam lines, calibrate\ndetectors and perform quick validations of usersâ detection\nsystems.",
        "FRIB": "harvesting program [11] will be used to produce unique\nbeams for the science program and applications. Ultimately,\nthe SOL project, a solid-stopper prototype, will be able\nto provide low-Z radioactive beams at high intensities of\ninterest for fundamental symmetry and p-capture reactions\nstudies.",
