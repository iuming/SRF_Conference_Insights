SRF Conference Insights - HIAT2025 Conference Data Extractor

This module provides data extraction capabilities for the HIAT2025 conference papers.
Currently serves as a placeholder for future implementation of real data extraction
from the official HIAT2025 conference website.

Author: Ming Liu <mliu@ihep.ac.cn>
Project: SRF Conference Insights
Institution: Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

Features:
- Template for HIAT2025 paper data extraction
- Compatible with SRF Conference Insights data schema
- Extensible architecture for future implementation

Dependencies:
- json: Data serialization and file operations
- requests: HTTP client for web scraping (future use)
- beautifulsoup4: HTML parsing (future use)

Development Log:
- v1.0: Initial template implementation
- v1.1: Schema compatibility with main system
- v1.2: Placeholder for real data extraction capabilities

Usage:
    python hiat2025_extractor.py
    
Output:
    Placeholder data structure compatible with the main analysis system
